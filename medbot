(watch the video to hear a woman discuss surviving breast cancer.) there are several ways to treat breast cancer, but all treatments work best when the disease is found early. as a matter of fact, when it is caught in its earliest stage, 98.5 percent of women with the disease are alive five years later. every day researchers are working to find new and better ways to detect and treat cancer. many studies of new approaches for women with breast cancer are under way. with early detection, and prompt and appropriate treatment, the outlook for women with breast cancer can be positive. to learn more about what happens after treatment, see surviving cancer.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': \"<question>what are the treatments for breast cancer ?<answer>there are a number of treatments for breast cancer, but the ones women choose most often -- alone or in combination -- are surgery, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. what standard treatments do here is what the standard cancer treatments are designed to do. -

modified radical mastectomy: surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles. this type of surgery is most common in pregnant women. - breast-conserving surgery: surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. this type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery. even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, the patient may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. for pregnant women with early-stage breast cancer, radiation therapy and hormone therapy are given after the baby is born. treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is not given to pregnant women with early stage (stage i or ii) breast cancer because it can harm the unborn baby. for women with late stage (stage iii or iv) breast cancer, radiation therapy is not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy and is delayed until after the baby is born, if possible. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. chemotherapy is usually not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy. chemotherapy given after this time does not usually harm the unborn baby but may cause early labor and low birth weight. see drugs approved for breast cancer for more information. ending the pregnancy does not seem to improve the mothers chance of survival. because ending the pregnancy is not likely to improve the mothers chance of survival, it is not usually a treatment option. treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. treatment options by stage early stage breast cancer (stage i and stage ii) treatment of early-stage breast cancer (stage i and stage ii) may include the following: -

prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: age prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. the chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older. family history of prostate cancer a man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer. race prostate cancer occurs more often in african-american men than in white men. african-american men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. hormones the prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. the main male sex hormone is testosterone. testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (dht) by an enzyme in the body. dht is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) found that vitamin e taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. the risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin e. folic acid folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. however, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their

hormones made by the body. these drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (dht). higher than normal levels of dht may play a part in developing prostate cancer. taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. the prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. the number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events trial (reduce) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. the number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: selenium and vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) studied whether taking vitamin e and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. the selenium and vitamin e were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for african-american men). the study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin e together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. diet it is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. in the pcpt trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. multivitamins regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. however, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. lycopene some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. it has not

middle age or later. in this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. the prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm. early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (psa) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. as the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. however, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer. the severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. in other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening. some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. the signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. if prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips. a small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. these hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. hereditary prostate

pressure and smoking. other risk factors, such as age and gender, you cant control. the major risk factors for stroke include: high blood pressure. high blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke. blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) over time. if you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmhg or higher. diabetes. diabetes is a disease in which the blood sugar level is high because the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy. heart diseases.coronary heart disease,cardiomyopathy,heart failure, andatrial fibrillationcan cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke. smoking. smoking can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure. smoking also may reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches your bodys tissues. exposure to secondhand smoke also can damage the blood vessels. age and gender. your risk of stroke increases as you get older. at younger ages, men are more likely than women to have strokes. however, women are more likely to die from strokes. women who take birth control pills also are at slightly higher risk of stroke. race and ethnicity. strokes occur more often in african american, alaska native, and american indian adults than in white, hispanic, or asian american adults. personal or family history of stroke or tia. if youve had a stroke, youre at higher risk for another one. your risk of having a repeat stroke is the highest right after a stroke. a tia also increases your risk of having a stroke, as does having a family history of stroke. brainaneurysmsor arteriovenous malformations (avms). aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. avms are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture (break open) within the brain. avms may be present at birth, but often arent diagnosed until they rupture. other risk factors for stroke, many of which of you can control, include: alcohol and illegal drug use, including cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), and bleeding disorders lack of physical activity overweight and obesity stress and depression unhealthy cholesterol levels unhealthy diet use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), but not aspirin, may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly in patients who have had a heart attack or cardiac

treatment on the way to the emergency room. during a stroke, every minute counts. overview the two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-ke-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-raj-ik). ischemic is the more common type of stroke. an ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. a hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). the pressure from the leaked blood damages brain cells. high blood pressure and aneurysms (an-u-risms) are examples of conditions that can cause hemorrhagic strokes. (aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst.) another condition thats similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack, also called a tia or mini-stroke. a tia occurs if blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked only for a short time. thus, damage to the brain cells isnt permanent (lasting). like ischemic strokes, tias often are caused by blood clots. although tias are not full-blown strokes, they greatly increase the risk of having a stroke. if you have a tia, its important for your doctor to find the cause so you can take steps to prevent a stroke. both strokes and tias require emergency care. outlook stroke is a leading cause of death in the united states. many factors can raise your risk of having a stroke. talk with your doctor about how you can control these risk factors and help prevent a stroke. if you have a stroke, prompt treatment can reduce damage to your brain and help you avoid lasting disabilities. prompt treatment also may help prevent another stroke. researchers continue to study the causes and risk factors for stroke. theyre also finding new and better treatments and new ways to help the brain repair itself after a stroke.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': \"<question>what is (are) stroke ?<answer>brain plasticity is the brain's ability to learn and change, allowing it to adapt to deficits and injury and to take over the functions of damaged cells. when cells in an area of the brain responsible for a particular function die after a stroke, the patient becomes unable to perform that function. however, the brain's ability torewire the connections between its nerve cells allows it to compensate for lost functions.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>what are the symptoms of skin cancer ?<answer>skin cancer is usually visible. changes in your skin, such as lumps, scabs, red spots, rough patches, or new or irregular moles should be reported to your doctor. you should also see a doctor if you have a mole, birthmark, or other pigmented area of skin that can be classified by the abcde symptom system. abcde stands for melanoma skin cancer is more difficult to treat, so it is important to check for signs and seek treatment as soon as possible. use the following abcde rule to remember the symptoms of melanoma. see a doctor if you have a mole, birthmark, or other pigmented area of skin with a = asymmetry. one half of the mole looks different than the other half.

procedures that examine the skin are used to detect (find) and diagnose nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. - certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin. the skin is the bodys largest organ. it protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin d. the skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells: - squamous cells: thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis. - basal cells: round cells under the squamous cells. - melanocytes: cells that make melanin and are found in the lower part of the epidermis. melanin is the pigment that gives skin its natural color. when skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken. skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms. there are different types of cancer that start in the skin. the most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers. nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. melanoma is a much rarer type of skin cancer. it is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. actinic keratosis is a skin condition that sometimes becomes squamous cell carcinoma. this summary is about nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. see the following pdq summaries for information on melanoma and other kinds of cancer that affect the skin: - melanoma treatment - mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome treatment - kaposi sarcoma treatment - merkel cell carcinoma treatment - unusual cancers of

and pipe smoking - secondhand smoke - family history - hiv infection - environmental risk factors - beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers - the following are protective factors for lung cancer: - not smoking - quitting smoking - lower exposure to workplace risk factors - lower exposure to radon - it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer: - diet - physical activity - the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer: - beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers - vitamin e supplements - cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - new ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials. avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer. avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. the following are risk factors for lung cancer: cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer. studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. people who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke. secondhand smoke being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or that is exhaled by smokers. people who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking. family history having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. people with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke, it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke. hiv infection being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. people infected with hiv may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. since smoking rates are higher in those infected with hiv than in those not infected, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from hiv infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke. environmental risk factors - radiation exposure: being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon are sources of radiation exposure: - atomic bomb radiation: being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer. - radiation therapy: radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers, including breast cancer and hodgkin lymphoma. radiation therapy uses x-rays, gamma rays, or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. the higher the dose of radiation received, the higher the risk. the risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers. - imaging tests: imaging tests, such as ct scans, expose patients to radiation. low-dose spiral ct scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose ct scans. in lung cancer screening, the use of low-dose spiral ct scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation. - radon: radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. it seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up over time. studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. the risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. in people who have never smoked, about 30% of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon. - workplace exposure: studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer: - asbestos. - arsenic. - chromium. - nickel. - beryllium. - cadmium. - tar and soot. these substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. as the level of exposure to these substances increases, the risk of lung cancer also increases. the risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke. - air pollution: studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer. beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers taking beta carotene supplements (pills) increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. the risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day. the following are protective factors for lung cancer: not smoking the best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke. quitting smoking smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. in smokers who have been treated for lung cancer, quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. counseling, the use of nicotine replacement products, and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good. in a person who has quit smoking, the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. after a person has quit smoking for 10 years, the risk of lung cancer decreases 30% to 50%. see the following for more information on quitting smoking: - tobacco (includes help with quitting) - cigarette smoking: health risks and how to quit lower exposure to workplace risk factors laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke. lower exposure to radon lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers. high levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage, such as sealing basements. it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer: diet some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. however, since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers, it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking. physical activity some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. however, since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers, it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer. the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer: beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer. vitamin e supplements studies show that taking vitamin e supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking

early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. instead, the doctor may put a tube up the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. this is called a local excision. if the cancer is found in a polyp, which is a small bulging piece of tissue, the operation is called a polypectomy. if the cancer is larger, the surgeon will remove the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. this is called a colectomy. the surgeon may then sew the healthy parts of the colon together. usually, the surgeon will also remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer. if the doctor is not able to sew the two ends of the colon back together, an opening called a stoma is made on the abdomen for waste to pass out of the body before it reaches the rectum. this procedure is called a colostomy. sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. but if

colorectal cancer. colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum. the colon and rectum are parts of the body's digestive system. the digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. the digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. the colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6-8 inches long. the anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body). cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. cancer that begins in either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer. see the following pdq summaries for more information about colorectal cancer: - colorectal cancer prevention - colon cancer treatment - rectal cancer treatment - genetics of colorectal cancer colorectal cancer is the

to diagnose heart attack ?<answer>your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. diagnostic tests ekg (electrocardiogram) an ekg is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. an ekg can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (chd) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. blood tests during a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, ck or ckmb tests, and serum myoglobin tests. blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. coronary angiography coronary angiography (an-jee-og-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. this test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. to get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (kath-e-ter-ih-za-shun). a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. the tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. the dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. if your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure calledpercutaneous (per-ku-ta-ne-us) coronary intervention (pci), sometimes referred to ascoronary angioplasty(an-jee-oh-plas-tee).

blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen. if blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. heart attack treatment works best when its given right after symptoms occur. if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if youre not sure, call 911 right away. overview heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (chd), also called coronary artery disease. chd is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. these arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. when plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. the buildup of plaque occurs over many years. eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. this causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. if the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. if the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. this heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. heart with muscle damage and a blocked artery a less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. the spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis. heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away. don't wait--get help quickly acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: chest pain or discomfort.most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. the discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. it can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. it also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. upper body discomfort.you may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). shortness of breath.this may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. it can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. other possible symptoms of a heart attack include: breaking out in a cold sweat feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting light-headedness or sudden dizziness any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on tv or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. the symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. if you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. quick action can save your life: call 911 if you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. call 911 for emergency medical care. acting fast can save your life. do not drive to the

coronary heart disease (chd), high blood pressure, or diabetes rule out other causes of your symptoms find any damage to your heart and check how well your heart pumps blood early diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives. medical and family histories your doctor will ask whether you or others in your family have or have had a disease or condition that can cause heart failure. your doctor also will ask about your symptoms. he or she will want to know which symptoms you have, when they occur, how long you've had them, and how severe they are. your answers will help show whether and how much your symptoms limit your daily routine. physical exam during the physical exam, your doctor will: listen to your heart for sounds that aren't normal listen to your lungs for the sounds of extra fluid buildup look for swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and the veins in your neck diagnostic tests no single test can diagnose heart failure. if you have signs and symptoms of heart failure, your doctor may recommend one or more tests. your doctor also may refer you to a cardiologist. a cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. ekg (electrocardiogram) an ekg is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. the test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. an ekg may show whether the walls in your heart's pumping chambers are thicker than normal. thicker walls can make it harder for your heart to pump blood. an ekg also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack. chest x ray a chest x raytakes pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. this test can show whether your heart is enlarged, you have fluid in your lungs, or you have lung disease. bnp blood test this test checks the level of a hormone in your blood called bnp. the level of this hormone rises during heart failure. echocardiography echocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. the test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves work. echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and heart muscle damage caused by lack of blood flow. echo might be done before and after a stress test (see below). a stress echo can show how well blood is flowing through your heart. the test also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. doppler ultrasound a doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure the speed and direction of blood flow. this test often is done with echo to give a more complete picture of blood flow to the heart and lungs. doctors often use doppler ultrasound to help diagnose right-side heart failure. holter monitor a holter monitor records your heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period, while you go about your normal daily routine. you wear small patches called electrodes on your chest. wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. the recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck. nuclear heart scan a nuclear heart scan shows how well blood is flowing through your heart and how much blood is reaching your heart muscle. during a nuclear heart scan, a safe, radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into your bloodstream through a vein. the tracer travels to your heart and releases energy. special cameras outside of your body detect the energy and use it to create pictures of your heart. a nuclear heart scan can show where the heart muscle is healthy and where it's damaged. a positron emission tomography (pet) scan is a type of nuclear heart scan. it shows the level of chemical activity in areas of your heart. this test can help your doctor see whether enough blood is flowing to these areas. a pet scan can show blood flow problems that other tests might not detect. cardiac catheterization during cardiac catheterization (kath-eh-ter-ih-za-shun), a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. this allows your doctor to look inside your coronary (heart) arteries. during this procedure, your doctor can check the pressure and blood flow in your heart chambers, collect blood samples, and use x rays to look at your coronary arteries. coronary angiography coronary angiography (an-jee-og-rah-fee) usually is done with cardiac catheterization. a dye that can be seen on x ray is injected into your bloodstream through the tip of the catheter. the dye allows your doctor to see the flow of blood to your heart muscle. angiography also shows how well your heart is pumping. stress test some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. during stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast. you may walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle. if you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate. heart tests, such as nuclear heart scanning and echo, often are done during stress testing. cardiac mri cardiac mri (magnetic resonance imaging) uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it's beating. the test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels. a cardiac mri can show whether parts of your heart are damaged. doctors also have used mri in research studies to find early signs of heart failure, even before symptoms appear. thyroid function tests thyroid function tests show how well your thyroid gland is working. these tests include blood tests, imaging tests, and tests to stimulate the thyroid. having too much or too little thyroid hormone in the blood can lead to heart failure.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ...,   534, 37151, 45894]), 'attention_mask':

blood pressure ?<answer>changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function. biology and high blood pressure researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. the key functions affected in high blood pressure include: kidney fluid and salt balances renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function kidney fluid and salt balances the kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. sympathetic nervous system activity the sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. blood vessel structure and function changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. the angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. genetic causes of high blood pressure much of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. high blood pressure often runs in families. years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. however, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. emerging research suggests that certain dna changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. environmental causes of high blood pressure environmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines. unhealthy lifestyle habits unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including: high dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking excess amounts of alcohol lack of physical activity overweight and obesity research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. medicines prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. this happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure. other medical causes of high blood pressure other medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. this happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,  5640,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0,

difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. it affects about half a million people in the united states although the numbers may be much higher. the average age of onset is 60 years, and the risk of developing parkinson\\'s goes up with age. parkinson\\'s disease was first described in 1817 by james parkinson, a british doctor who published a paper on what he called \"the shaking palsy.\" in this paper, he described the major symptoms of the disease that would later bear his name. four main symptoms parkinson\\'s disease belongs to a group of neurological conditions called movement disorders. the four main symptoms of parkinson\\'s are: - tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head - rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk - bradykinesia, or slowness of movement - postural instability, or impaired balance. tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk bradykinesia, or slowness of movement postural instability, or impaired balance. parkinson\\'s symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. as the symptoms become more severe, people with the disorder may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. they also experience non-motor, or movement, symptoms including mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue. parkinson\\'s disease not only affects the brain, but the entire body. while the brain involvement is responsible for the core features, other affected locations contribute to the complicated picture of parkinson\\'s. parkinson\\'s disease is both chronic, meaning it lasts for a long time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. it is not contagious. diagnosis can be difficult about 60,000 americans are diagnosed with parkinson\\'s disease each year. however, it\\'s difficult to know exactly how many have it because many people in the early stages of the disease think their symptoms are due to normal aging and do not seek help from a doctor. also, diagnosis is sometimes difficult because there are no medical tests that can diagnose the disease with certainty and because other conditions may produce symptoms of parkinson\\'s. for example, people with parkinson\\'s may sometimes be told by their doctors that they have other disorders, and people with diseases similar to parkinson\\'s may be incorrectly diagnosed as having parkinson\\'s. a persons good response to the drug levodopa may support the diagnosis. levodopa is the main therapy for parkinsons disease. who is at risk? both men and women can have parkinsons disease. however, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women. while the disease is more common in developed countries, studies also have found an increased risk of parkinson\\'s disease in people who live in rural areas and in those who work in certain professions, suggesting that environmental factors may play a role in the disorder. researchers are focusing on additional risk factors for parkinsons disease. one clear risk factor for parkinson\\'s is age. the average age of onset is 60 years and the risk rises significantly with advancing age. however, about 5 to 10 percent of people with parkinson\\'s have \"early-onset\" disease which begins before the age of 50. early-onset forms of parkinson\\'s are often inherited, though not always, and some have been linked to specific gene mutations. juvenile parkinsonism in very rare cases, parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20. this condition is called juvenile parkinsonism. it is most commonly seen in japan but has been found in other countries as well. it usually begins with dystonia (sustained muscle contractions causing twisting movements) and bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and the symptoms often improve with levodopa medication. juvenile parkinsonism often runs in families and is sometimes linked to a mutated gene. some cases are inherited evidence suggests that, in some cases, parkinsons disease may be inherited. an estimated 15 to 25 percent of people with parkinson\\'s have a known relative with the disease. people with one or more close relatives who have parkinson\\'s have an increased risk of developing the disease themselves, but the total risk is still just 2 to 5 percent unless the family has a known gene mutation for the disease. a gene mutation is a change or alteration in the dna or genetic material that makes up a gene. researchers have discovered several genes that are linked to parkinson\\'s disease. the first to be identified was alpha-synuclein or snca. inherited cases of parkinsons disease are caused by mutations in the lrrk2, park2 or parkin, park7 or dj-1, pink1, or snca genes, or by mutations in genes that have not yet been identified.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ...,  1865,   587,  5174]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1,

throughout the body. - platelets help control bleeding by forming blood clots. white blood cells fight infection and disease. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. platelets help control bleeding by forming blood clots. in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, called leukemia cells. at first, leukemia cells function almost normally. but over time, as more leukemia cells are produced, they may crowd out the healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. this makes it difficult for the blood to carry out its normal functions. there

(the word \"osteoporosis\" means \"porous bone.\") the outside of long bones -- called the cortex -- also thins, further weakening the bone. sometime around the age of 30, bone mass stops increasing, and the goal for bone health is to keep as much bone as possible for as long as you can. in most women, the rate of bone loss increases for several years after menopause, then slows down again, but continues. in men, the bone loss occurs more slowly. but by age 65 or 70, most men and women are losing bone at the same rate. weak bones can lead to fractures osteoporosis is often called \"silent\" because bone loss occurs without symptoms. people may not know that they have osteoporosis until a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes a bone to break. this can result in a trip to the hospital, surgery, and possibly a long-term disabling condition. broken bones in your spine are painful and very slow to heal. people with weak bones in their spine gradually lose height and their posture becomes hunched over. over time a bent spine can make it hard to walk or even sit up. broken hips are a very serious problem as we age. they greatly increase the risk of death, especially during the year after they break. people who break a hip might not recover for months or even years. because they often cannot care for themselves, they are more likely to have to live in a nursing home. prevention and treatment the good news is that osteoporosis can often be prevented and treated. healthy lifestyle choices such as proper diet, exercise, and treatment medications can help prevent further bone loss and reduce the risk of fractures.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>what are the treatments for osteoporosis ?<answer>a comprehensive osteoporosis treatment program includes a focus on proper nutrition, exercise, and safety issues to prevent falls that may result in fractures. in addition, your doctor may prescribe a medication to slow or stop bone loss, increase bone density, and reduce fracture risk. nutrition. the foods we eat contain a variety of vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients that help keep our bodies healthy. all of these nutrients are needed in balanced proportion. in particular, calcium and vitamin d are needed for strong bones and for your heart, muscles, and nerves to function properly. exercise. exercise is an important component of an osteoporosis prevention and treatment program. exercise not only improves your bone health, but it increases muscle strength, coordination, and balance, and leads to better overall health. although exercise is good for someone with osteoporosis, it should not put any sudden or excessive strain on your bones. as extra insurance against fractures, your doctor can recommend specific exercises to strengthen and support your back. therapeutic medications. several medications are available for the prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis, including: bisphosphonates; estrogen agonists/antagonists (also called selective estrogen receptor modulators or serms); calcitonin; parathyroid hormone; estrogen therapy; hormone therapy; and a recently approved rank ligand (rankl) inhibitor.

(watch the video to learn more about shingles. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) what causes shingles? shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. it is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. the early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. the virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. it stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. shingles and pain the most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (phn). people with phn have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. in most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from phn for years. persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. in fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. as people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. other complications shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. - bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - in a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin. - the burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression. - in patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. these cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal. - very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. in a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin. the burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression. in patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. these cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal. very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. shingles usually does not return people who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. however, a person can have a second or even a third episode. the shingles vaccine adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. the vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. if you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (see more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter prevention.) is shingles contagious? shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. however, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. in such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. the virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. a person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. a person is not infectious before the blisters appear. once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. if you have shingles if you have shingles, - keep the rash covered - avoid touching or scratching the rash - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. until

severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. after several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. shingles pain can be mild or intense. some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. the most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. when the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. the viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]),

the nerve damage and speed healing. but to be effective, they must be started as soon as possible after the rash appears. if you suspect you have shingles, see your healthcare provider within 72 hours of the first sign of the rash. at the early stage of shingles, a healthcare provider will usually prescribe antiviral pills. these antiviral medicines include acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famcyclovir, your healthcare provider, may also prescribe drugs to relieve pain. wet compresses, calamine lotion, and colloidal oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching. patients with long-term pain may also be treated with numbing patches, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication. the shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. while these treatments can reduce the symptoms of shingles, they are not a cure. the antivirals do weaken the virus and its effects, but the outbreak still tends to run its

shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. as you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. it is with you for life. the virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. but it can become active again. somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. this triggers the reactivation. when the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. the nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. the pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. risk factors the leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. one out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. another risk factor is aging. as we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. the shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, hiv/aids, or a transplant operation. stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. while stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. most cases of shingles occur in adults. only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. with children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. there have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them

remains unclear exactly what initiates polycythemia vera, researchers believe that it begins when mutations occur in the dna of a hematopoietic stem cell. these stem cells are located in the bone marrow and have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. jak2 gene mutations seem to be particularly important for the development of polycythemia vera, as nearly all affected individuals have a mutation in this gene. the jak2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. the jak2 protein is especially important for controlling the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells. jak2 gene mutations result in the production of a jak2 protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which increases production of blood cells and prolongs their survival. with so many extra cells in the bloodstream, abnormal blood clots are more likely to form. thicker blood also flows more slowly throughout the body, which prevents organs from receiving enough oxygen. many of the signs and symptoms of polycythemia vera are related to a shortage of oxygen in body tissues. the function of the tet2 gene is unknown. although mutations in the tet2 gene have been found in approximately 16 percent of people with polycythemia vera, it is unclear what role these

are more likely to form and block the flow of blood through arteries and veins. individuals with polycythemia vera have an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (dvt), a type of blood clot that

your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. it stays in your blood instead. your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. however, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. with this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. to survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. learn more about type 1 diabetes here. type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. as a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. at first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. learn more about type 2 diabetes here. gestational diabetes some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. prediabetes prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. learn more about prediabetes here. signs of diabetes many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. some lose weight without trying. additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. how many have diabetes? nearly 29 million americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). about 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. people can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. in 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the u.s -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. see more statistics about diabetes from the national diabetes statistics report 2014.

simple, inexpensive, and safe. based on the severity of the iron overload, a patient will have phlebotomy to remove a pint of blood once or twice a week for several months to a year, and occasionally longer. health care providers will test serum ferritin levels periodically to monitor iron levels. the goal is to bring serum ferritin levels to the low end of the average range and keep them there. depending on the lab, the level is 25 to 50 g/l. after phlebotomy reduces serum ferritin levels to the desired level, patients may need maintenance phlebotomy treatment every few months. some patients may need phlebotomies more often. serum ferritin tests every 6 months or once a year will help determine how often a patient should have blood drawn. many blood donation centers provide free phlebotomy treatment for people with hemochromatosis. treating hemochromatosis before organs are damaged can prevent complications such as cirrhosis, heart problems, arthritis, and diabetes. treatment cannot cure these conditions in patients who already have them at diagnosis. however, treatment will help most of these conditions improve. the treatments effectiveness depends on the degree of organ damage. for example, treating hemochromatosis can stop the progression of liver damage in its early stages and lead to a normal life expectancy. however, if a patient develops cirrhosis, his or her

and they build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick, scaly patches. types of psoriasis psoriasis occurs in five different forms that affect both men and women. most people have only one type

understand and treat psoriasis are making headway in several different areas. the role of t cells scientists believe that psoriasis occurs when white blood cells called t cells, which normally help fight infections, attack the bodys skin cells by mistake. scientists are working to understand what causes these cells to go awry in people with psoriasis. their hope is that by better understanding why t cells attack the bodys healthy skin tissue, they can develop better treatments to stop or prevent that damaging process. new treatments since discovering that t cells attack skin cells in psoriasis, researchers have been studying new treatments that quiet immune system reactions in the skin. among these are treatments that block the activity of t cells or block cytokines (proteins that promote inflammation). if researchers find a way to target only the disease-causing immune reactions while leaving the rest of the immune system alone, resulting treatments could benefit psoriasis patients as well as those with other autoimmune diseases (when the immune system attacks the bodys own tissues). currently there are a number of potential psoriasis treatments in clinical trials, including injections, pills, and topical ointments. clinical trials are research studies with volunteers in which drugs are tested for the effectiveness and safety. all drugs must complete and pass this process before they can be approved by the fda. psoriasis genes because psoriasis is more common among people who have one or more family members with the disease, scientists have long suspected that genes are involved. a number of genetic loci specific locations on the genes have been associated with the development of psoriasis or the severity or progression of the disease. in 2012, scientists discovered the first gene to be directly linked to development of plaque psoriasis. researchers continue to study the genetic aspects of psoriasis, and some studies are looking at the nervous system to determine the genes responsible for the circuitry that causes itching. psoriasis-related conditions research in recent years has shown that people with psoriasis are more likely to develop other health problems, including problems with the heart and blood vessels. research is continuing to examine links between psoriasis and other health problems. scientists are working to understand how and why these diseases occur in people with psoriasis, with the hope that this understanding will lead to better treatments for both psoriasis and the related diseases. stress reduction treatment for many people with psoriasis, life stresses cause the disease to worsen or become more active. research suggests that stress is associated with the increased production of chemicals by the immune system that promote inflammation. the same chemicals may play a role in the anxiety and depression that is common in people with psoriasis. researchers are studying the use of stress reduction techniques, along with medical treatment, in the hope that reducing stress will both lower anxiety and improve the skin lesions of psoriasis. where to find more information more information on

disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and skeleton. symptoms typically present in infancy or early childhood. the severity of the disorder varies among affected individuals, even within the same family. symptoms range from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe enough to require heart and/or liver transplants. one of the major features of alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. these ducts carry bile (which helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. in alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number. this results in a build-up of bile causing scarring that prevents the liver from working properly. this may lead to jaundice, itchy skin, and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). alagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (pulmonic stenosis). other heart-related problems include a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect) and a combination of heart defects called tetralogy of fallot. people with alagille syndrome may also have distinctive facial features (including a broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin), problems with the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the kidneys, and an unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). detailed information about the symptoms associated with allagille syndrome can be accessed through the

times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (dehydration). additional symptoms can include unusually pale skin (pallor), abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) or to sound (phonophobia). in most affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. these attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to work or school. episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy can occur regularly or apparently at random, or can be triggered by a variety of factors. the most common triggers are emotional excitement and infections. other triggers can include periods without eating (fasting), temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol, and menstruation. if the condition is not treated, episodes usually occur four to 12 times per year. between attacks, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. however, many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including pain, lethargy, digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, and fainting spells (syncope). people with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people without the disorder to experience depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. it is unclear whether these

found in wheat, rye, and barley. celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body. celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. the classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. this inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. in celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus. inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. these health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. this form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form. celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. on average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin. some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. however, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. they also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy. in a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called

progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it hard to breathe. you may also have heard copd called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. in people who have copd, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. copd is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. it kills more than 120,000 americans each year. that\\'s one death every 4 minutes. how copd affects airways the \"airways\" are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. the airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. at the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. in healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). when you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. in people with copd, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - the airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. - the walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. - the walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. - cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. the

things that irritate the lungs. some of the things that put you at risk for copd include smoking, environmental exposure, and genetic factors. cigarette smoking is the most common cause of copd in the united states (either current or former smokers). pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can also cause copd, especially if the smoke is inhaled. environmental exposure copd can also occur in people who have had long-term exposure to things that can irritate your lungs, like chemical fumes, or dust from the environment or workplace. heavy or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to copd even if you have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. secondhand smoke is smoke in the air from other people smoking. genetic factors in a small number of people, copd is caused by a genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin, or aat, deficiency. people who have this condition have low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (aat)a protein made in the liver. having a low level of the aat protein can lead to lung damage and copd if you're exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. if you have this condition and smoke, copd can worsen very quickly. while very few people know if they have aat deficiency, it is estimated that about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people have it. people with aat deficiency can get copd even if they have never smoked or had long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. asthma although uncommon, some people who have asthma can develop copd. asthma is a chronic (long-term)

ever felt dizzy, lightheaded, or as if the room were spinning around you? these can be very troublesome sensations. if the feeling happens often, it could be a sign of a balance problem. balance problems are among the most common reasons that older adults seek help from a doctor. in 2008, an estimated 14.8 percent of american adults (33.4 million) had a balance or dizziness problem during the past year. why good balance is important having good balance means being able to control and maintain your body's position, whether you are moving or remaining still. an intact sense of balance helps you - walk without staggering - get up from a chair without falling - climb stairs without tripping - bend over without falling. walk without staggering get up from a chair without falling climb stairs without tripping bend over without falling. the part of the inner ear responsible for balance is the vestibular system, often referred to as the labyrinth. to maintain your body's position, the labyrinth interacts with other systems in the body, such as the eyes, bones and joints. good balance is important to help you get around, stay independent, and carry out daily activities. learn how your body maintains its balance. when people have problems with balance as they get older, many people experience problems with their sense of balance. they feel dizzy or unsteady, or as if they or their surroundings were in motion. disturbances of the inner ear are a common cause. vertigo, the feeling that you or the things around you are spinning, is also a common symptom. balance disorders are one reason older people fall. falls and fall-related injuries, such as hip fracture, can have a serious impact on an older person's life. if you fall, it could limit your activities or make it impossible to live independently. many people often become more isolated after a fall. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, roughly more than one-third of adults ages 65 years and older fall each year. among older adults, falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths. learn other ways a fall may affect an older adult's life. bppv (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) there are many types of balance disorders. one of the most common is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or bppv. in bppv, you experience a brief, intense feeling of vertigo when you change the position of your head, such as when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out of bed, or when looking for an object on a high or low shelf. bppv is more likely to occur in adults aged 60 and older, but can also occur in younger people. in bppv, small calcium particles in the inner ear become displaced and disrupt the inner ear balance sensors, causing dizziness. the reason they become displaced is not known; the cause may be an inner ear infection, head injury, or aging. labyrinthitis this is an infection or inflammation of the inner ear that causes dizziness and loss of balance. it is often associated with an upper respiratory infection such as the flu. mnire's disease mnire's disease is a balance disorder that causes a person to experience - vertigo - hearing loss that comes

balance disorders are caused by problems in the inner ear. the part of the inner ear that is responsible for balance is the vestibular system, also known as the labyrinth. when the labyrinth becomes infected or swollen, this condition is called labyrinthitis. it is typically accompanied by vertigo and imbalance. upper respiratory infections and other viral infections, and, less commonly, bacterial infections, can lead to labyrinthitis. other causes other balance diseorers may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. for example, diseases of the circulatory system, such as stroke, can cause dizziness and other balance problems. smoking and diabetes can increase the risk of stroke. low blood pressure can also cause dizziness. aging, infections, head injury and many medicines may also result in a balance problem. problems caused by medications balance problems can also result from taking many medications. for example, some medicines, such as those that help lower blood pressure, can make a person feel dizzy. ototoxic drugs are medicines that damage the inner ear. if your medicine is ototoxic, you may feel off balance. sometimes the damage lasts only as long as you take the drug; many times it is permanent. groups of drugs that are more likely to be ototoxic include - antidepressants - anti-seizure drugs (anticonvulsants) - hypertensive (high blood pressure) drugs - sedatives - tranquilizers - anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs) - aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic) - diuretics - vasodilators - certain analgesics (painkillers) - certain

taking a medication. ask if other medications can be used instead. if not, ask if the dosage can be safely reduced. sometimes it cannot. however, your doctor will help you get the medication you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. diet and lifestyle can help your diet and lifestyle can help you manage certain balance-related problems. for example, mnire's disease, which causes vertigo and other balance and hearing problems, is linked to a change in the volume of fluid in the inner ear. by eating low-salt (low-sodium) or salt-free foods, and steering clear of caffeine and alcohol, you may make mnire's disease symptoms less severe. see suggestions for limiting salt (sodium) in your diet. balance problems due to high blood pressure can be managed by eating less salt (less sodium), maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising. balance problems due to low blood pressure may be managed by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, avoiding alcohol, and being cautious regarding your body's posture and movement, such as standing up slowly and avoiding crossing your legs when youre seated. learn more about managing high blood pressure (hypertension). learn more about

iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood). researchers have identified several types of porphyria, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their signs and symptoms. some types of porphyria, called cutaneous porphyrias, primarily affect the skin. areas of skin exposed to the sun become fragile and blistered, which can lead to infection, scarring, changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), and increased hair growth. cutaneous porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda. other types of porphyria, called acute porphyrias, primarily affect the nervous system. these disorders are described as \"acute\" because their signs and symptoms appear quickly and usually last a short time. episodes of acute porphyria can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. during an episode, a person may also experience muscle weakness, seizures, fever, and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations. these signs and symptoms can be life-threatening, especially if the muscles that control breathing become paralyzed. acute porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria and alad deficiency porphyria. two other forms of porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can have both acute and cutaneous symptoms. the porphyrias can also be split into erythropoietic and hepatic types, depending on where damaging compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors first build up in the body. in erythropoietic porphyrias, these compounds originate in the bone marrow. erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. health problems associated with erythropoietic porphyrias include a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). the other types of porphyrias are considered hepatic porphyrias. in these disorders, porphyrins and porphyrin precursors originate primarily in the liver, leading to abnormal liver function and an increased risk of developing liver cancer. environmental factors can strongly influence the occurrence and severity of signs and symptoms of porphyria. alcohol, smoking, certain drugs, hormones, other illnesses, stress, and dieting or periods without food (fasting) can all trigger the signs and symptoms of some forms of the disorder. additionally, exposure to sunlight worsens the skin damage in people with cutaneous porphyrias.<end>'}\n{'input_ids':

pictures of the bones and soft tissues and nearby areas help diagnose ewing sarcoma and show how far the cancer has spread. the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bones and soft tissues is called staging. in order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the cancer is in the area where it first formed or if it has spread to other parts of the body. tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage ewing sarcoma are usually done at the same time. the following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose or stage ewing sarcoma: - physical exam and history : an exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed or the chest, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. a pet scan and a ct scan are often done at the same time. if there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. - bone scan : a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. - bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. samples are removed from both hipbones. a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to see if the cancer has spread. - x-ray: an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest or the area where the tumor formed. - complete blood count (cbc): a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: - the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. - the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. - blood chemistry studies : a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. an unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. a biopsy is done to diagnose ewing sarcoma. tissue samples are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. it is helpful if the biopsy is done at the same center where treatment will be given. - needle biopsy : for a needle biopsy, tissue is removed using a needle. this type of needle biopsy may be done if its possible to remove tissue samples large enough to be used for testing. - incisional biopsy : for an incisional biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed through an incision in the skin. - excisional biopsy : the removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal. the specialists (pathologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon) who will treat the patient usually work together to decide where the needle should be placed or the biopsy incision should be made. this is done so that the biopsy doesn't affect later treatment such as surgery to remove the tumor or radiation therapy. if there is a chance that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, one or more lymph nodes may be removed and checked for signs of cancer. the following tests may be done on the tissue that is removed: - cytogenetic analysis : a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. - immunohistochemistry : a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. - flow cytometry : a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. the cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. the measurements

(see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information.) five types of standard treatment are used: chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. systemic chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with ewing tumors. it is often the first treatment given and lasts for about 6 to 12 months. chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy and to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body. see drugs approved for soft tissue sarcoma for more information. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. external radiation therapy is used to treat ewing sarcoma. radiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look. it may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. it may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body. surgery surgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. when possible, the whole tumor is removed by surgery. tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft, which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body or a donor. sometimes an implant, such as artificial bone, is used. even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma. it is being studied for the treatment of metastatic ewing sarcoma. monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. new types of targeted therapy are being studied. - kinase inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. kinase inhibitors are drugs that block a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. they are being studied in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma. - parp inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. parp inhibitors are drugs that block dna repair and may cause cancer cells to die. they are being studied in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma. high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy to treat ewing sarcoma and then replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by cancer treatment. stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. after chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. these reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat recurrent ewing sarcoma. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. it may not mention every new treatment being studied. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. chimeric antigen receptor (car) t-cell therapy car t-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's t cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. t cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. the changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cells. the car t cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. the car t cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. car t-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of ewing sarcoma that has recurred. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options for ewing sarcoma localized ewing sarcoma standard treatments for localized ewing sarcoma include: -

which also may be warm and red. attacks frequently occur at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol or drugs, or the presence of another illness. early attacks usually subside within 3 to 10 days, even without treatment, and the next attack may not occur for months or even years. where gout usually occurs sometime during the course of the disease, many patients will develop gout in the big toe. gout frequently affects joints in the lower part of the body such as the ankles, heels, knees, or toes. who is at risk? adult men, particularly those between the ages of 40 and 50, are more likely to develop gout than women, who rarely develop the disease before menstruation ends. a buildup of uric acid before an attack, needle-like crystals of uric acid build up in connective tissue, in the joint space between two bones, or in both. uric acid is a substance that results from the breakdown of purines, which are part of all human tissue and are found in many foods. normally, uric acid is dissolved in the blood and passed through the kidneys into the urine, where it is eliminated. if there is an increase in the production of uric acid or if the kidneys do not eliminate enough uric acid from the body, levels of it build up in the blood (a condition called hyperuricemia). hyperuricemia also may result when a person eats too many high-purine foods, such as liver, dried beans and peas, anchovies, and gravies. hyperuricemia is not a disease, and by itself it is not dangerous. however, if too many uric acid crystals form as a result of hyperuricemia, gout can develop. the crystals form and build up in the joint, causing inflammation. stages of gout gout can progress through four stages. asymptomatic (without symptoms) hyperuricemia. in this stage, a person has elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), but no other symptoms. treatment is usually not required. acute gout, or acute gouty arthritis. in this stage, hyperuricemia has caused uric acid crystals to build up in joint spaces. this leads to a sudden onset of intense pain and swelling in the joints, which also may be warm and very tender. an acute (sudden) attack commonly occurs at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol or drugs, or the presence of another illness. attacks usually subside within 3 to 10 days, even without treatment, and the next attack may not occur for months or even years. over time, however, attacks can last longer and occur more frequently. interval or intercritical gout. this is the period between acute attacks. in this stage, a person does not have any symptoms. chronic tophaceous (toe fay shus) gout. this is the most disabling stage of gout. it usually develops over a long period, such as 10 years. in this stage, the disease may have caused permanent damage to the affected joints and sometimes to the kidneys. with proper treatment, most people with gout do not progress to this advanced stage.<end>'}\n{'input_ids':

glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. how glaucoma develops there are several different types of glaucoma. most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. at the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. a clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) in glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. as the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. open-angle glaucoma the most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. in the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. when fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. if the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. there is no cure for glaucoma. vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. however, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. that is why early diagnosis is important. see this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more. see a glossary of glaucoma terms.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>what is (are) glaucoma ?<answer>national eye institute national institutes of health 2020 vision place bethesda, md 20892-3655 301-496-5248 e-mail: 2020@nei.nih.gov www.nei.nih.gov the glaucoma foundation 80 maiden lane, suite 700 new york, ny 10038 212-285-0080 glaucoma research foundation 251 post street, suite 600 san francisco, ca 94108 1-800-826-6693<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>what are the treatments for prescription and illicit drug abuse ?<answer>depending on the substance(s) involved, treatment may include medications, behavioral treatments, or a combination. a doctor, substance abuse counselor, or other health professional can determine the right treatment for an individual. treatment helps people reduce the powerful effects of drugs on the body and brain. in doing so, treatment helps people improve their physical health and everyday functioning and regain control of their lives. once in treatment, older adults do just as well or better than younger adults.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>what are the treatments for prescription and illicit drug abuse ?<answer>the first step in a substance treatment program is often detoxification (detox), the process of allowing the body to get rid of the substance. detoxification under medical supervision allows the symptoms of withdrawal to be treated, but is not addiction treatment in and of itself.

cushing's syndrome ?<answer>cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. many people develop cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. other people develop cushing's syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. first, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) to the pituitary gland. crh causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (acth), which stimulates the adrenal glands. when the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the acth, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream. cortisol performs vital tasks in the body including - helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats one of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. for this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. people suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels. when the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less crh and acth. this process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. however, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry. pituitary adenomas pituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. these benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra acth. most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. this form of the syndrome, known as cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men. ectopic acth syndrome some benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce acth. this condition is known as ectopic acth syndrome. lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women. the most common forms of acth-producing tumors are small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 13 percent of all lung cancer cases,2 and carcinoid tumors-small, slow-growing tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in various parts of the body. other less common types of tumors that can produce acth are thymomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid. adrenal tumors in rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes cushing's syndrome. adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood. adrenocortical carcinomas-adrenal cancers-are the least common cause of cushing's syndrome. with adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms. familial cushing's syndrome most cases of cushing's syndrome are not inherited. rarely, however, cushing's syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. with primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; cushing's syndrome in men1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,  5640,  ..., 50257,

are the treatments for cushing's syndrome ?<answer>treatment depends on the specific reason for excess cortisol and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs. if the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest dose adequate for control of that disorder. once control is established, the daily dose of glucocorticoid hormones may be doubled and given on alternate days to lessen side effects. in some cases, noncorticosteroid drugs can be prescribed. pituitary adenomas several therapies are available to treat the acth-secreting pituitary adenomas of cushing's disease. the most widely used treatment is surgical removal of the tumor, known as transsphenoidal adenomectomy. using a special microscope and fine instruments, the surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. because this procedure is extremely delicate, patients are often referred to centers specializing in this type of surgery. the success, or cure, rate of this procedure is more than 80 percent when performed by a surgeon with extensive experience. if surgery fails or only produces a temporary cure, surgery can be repeated, often with good results. after curative pituitary surgery, the production of acth drops two levels below normal. this drop is natural and temporary, and patients are given a synthetic form of cortisol such as hydrocortisone or prednisone to compensate. most people can stop this replacement therapy in less than 1 or 2 years, but some must be on it for life. if transsphenoidal surgery fails or a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery, radiation therapy is another possible treatment. radiation to the pituitary gland is given over a 6-week period, with improvement occurring in 40 to 50 percent of adults and up to 85 percent of children. another technique, called stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma knife radiation, can be given in a single high-dose treatment. it may take several months or years before people feel better from radiation treatment alone. combining radiation with cortisol-inhibiting drugs can help speed recovery. drugs used alone or in combination to control the production of excess cortisol are ketoconazole, mitotane, aminoglutethimide, and metyrapone. each drug has its own side effects that doctors consider when prescribing medical therapy for individual patients. ectopic acth syndrome to cure the overproduction of cortisol caused by ectopic acth syndrome, all of the cancerous tissue that is secreting acth must be eliminated. the choice of cancer treatment-surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatmentsdepends on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. because acth-secreting tumors may be small or widespread at the time of diagnosis, making them difficult to locate and treat directly, cortisol-inhibiting drugs are an important part of treatment. in some cases, if other treatments fail, surgical removal of the adrenal glands, called bilateral adrenalectomy, may replace drug therapy. adrenal tumors surgery is the mainstay of treatment for benign and cancerous tumors of the adrenal glands. primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease and the inherited carney complex-primary tumors of the heart that can lead to endocrine overactivity and cushing's syndrome-require surgical removal of the adrenal glands.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,

may block the protein in other conditions. the national heart, lung, and blood institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have marfan syndrome. the study\\'s goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation. surgery if your aorta stretches, it\\'s more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). to prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta. surgery may involve: a composite valve graft. for this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. the aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. a man-made valve replaces the original valve. aortic valve-sparing surgery. if your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. for this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. your aortic valve is left in place. after aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. for example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or \"blood thinners.\" blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. you\\'ll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. if you\\'ve had valve-sparing surgery, you\\'ll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes. if you\\'ve had a composite valve graft, you\\'re at increased risk for endocarditis (en-do-kar-di-tis). this is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis. your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery. after surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or cardiac computed tomography (ct) scans to check your aorta. cardiac mri is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. cardiac ct is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart. bone and joint treatments if you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery. some people who have marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. this surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart. eye treatments marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye\\'s lens). glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. sometimes surgery is needed. nervous system treatments marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. in this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. this can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines. lung treatments marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. in this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. if the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. however, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. sometimes surgery is needed.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ..., 23533,    13, 12317]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 1, 1, 1])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>how many people are

treatments for autoimmune hepatitis ?<answer>treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. treatment may also include a liver transplant. treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. people with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver. medications people with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. a health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. in some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function. corticosteroids. corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. the treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease. side effects of prednisone may include - weight gain - weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia - thinning of the hair and skin - acne - diabetes - high blood pressure - cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes - glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes - anxiety and confusion a health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis. immune system suppressors. medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. in most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (azasan, imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. when using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects. side effects of azathioprine include - low white blood cell count - nausea - vomiting - skin rash - liver damage - pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas azathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. a low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. a health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done. a person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. the risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis. a health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. when a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years. people who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (hecoria, prograf). medications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. people on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer. liver transplant in some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and - generalized itching - a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop - easy bruising - a swollen stomach or swollen ankles - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin - abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver - fluid in the abdomenalso called ascites - forgetfulness or confusion liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. a team of surgeons performs a

properly. the health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. the patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, liver transplantation.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids':

multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs, in this case tissues of the nervous system. multiple sclerosis usually begins in early adulthood, between ages 20 and 40. the symptoms vary widely, and affected individuals can experience one or more effects of nervous system damage. multiple sclerosis often causes sensory disturbances in the limbs, including a prickling or tingling sensation (paresthesia), numbness, pain, and itching. some people experience lhermitte sign, which is an electrical shock-like sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs. this sensation usually occurs when the head is bent forward. problems with muscle control are common in people with multiple sclerosis. affected individuals may have tremors, muscle stiffness (spasticity), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weakness or partial paralysis of the muscles of the limbs, difficulty walking, or poor bladder control. multiple sclerosis is also associated with vision problems, such as blurred or double vision or partial or complete vision loss. infections that cause fever can make the symptoms worse. there are several forms of multiple sclerosis: relapsing-remitting ms, secondary progressive ms, primary progressive ms, and progressive relapsing ms. the most common is the relapsing-remitting form, which affects approximately 80 percent of people with multiple sclerosis. individuals with this form of the condition have periods during which they experience symptoms, called clinical attacks, followed by periods without any symptoms (remission). the triggers of clinical attacks and remissions are unknown. after about 10 years, relapsing-remitting ms usually develops into another form of the disorder called secondary progressive ms. in this form, there are no remissions, and symptoms of the condition continually worsen. primary progressive ms is the next most common form, affecting approximately 10 to 20 percent of people with multiple sclerosis. this form is characterized by constant symptoms that worsen over time, with no clinical attacks or remissions. primary progressive ms typically begins later than the other forms, around age 40. progressive relapsing ms is a rare form of multiple sclerosis that initially appears like primary

hla-drb1*15:01, is the most strongly linked genetic factor. the il7r gene provides instructions for making one piece of two different receptor proteins: the interleukin 7 (il-7) receptor and the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp) receptor. both receptors are embedded in the cell membrane of immune cells. these receptors stimulate signaling pathways that induce the growth and division (proliferation) and survival of immune cells. the genetic variation involved in multiple sclerosis leads to production of an il-7 receptor that is not embedded in the cell membrane but is instead found inside the cell. it is unknown if this variation affects the tslp receptor. because the hla-drb1 and il-7r genes are involved in the immune system, changes in either might be related to the autoimmune response that damages the myelin sheath and nerve cells and leads to the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis. however, it is unclear exactly what role variations in either gene plays

our most robust senses. although there is a small decline in taste in people over 60, most older people will not notice it because normal aging does not greatly affect our sense of taste. problems with taste occur less frequently than problems with smell. how our sense of taste works our sense of taste, along with our sense of smell, is part of our chemical sensing system. normal taste occurs when tiny molecules released by chewing or the digestion of food stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat. these taste cells, or gustatory cells, send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain, where specific tastes are identified. damage to these nerves following head injury can lead to taste loss. the taste cells are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and along the lining of the throat. many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tip of the tongue contain taste buds. at birth, we have about 10,000 taste buds scattered on the back, sides, and tip of the tongue. after age 50, we may start to lose taste buds. five taste sensations we can experience five basic taste sensations: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, or savory. umami is the taste we get from glutamate, a building block of protein found in chicken broth, meat stock, and some cheeses. umami is also the taste associated wtih msg (monosodium glutamate) that is often added to foods as a flavor enhancer. the five taste qualities combine with other oral sensations, such as texture, spiciness, temperature, and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor. it is flavor that lets us know whether we are eating an apple or a pear. flavors and the sense of smell many people are surprised to learn that we recognize flavors largely through our sense of smell. try holding your nose while eating chocolate. you will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness, but you can't identify the chocolate flavor. that's because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing. food flavor is affected by a head cold or nasal congestion because the aroma of food does not reach the sensory cells that detect odors. more information on this topic can be found in the topic problems with smell smell and taste closely linked smell and taste are closely linked senses. many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste, when they are really experiencing a problem with smell. it is common for people who lose their sense of smell to say that food has lost its taste. this is incorrect; the food has lost its aroma, but taste remains. in older people, there is a normal decline in the sense of smell and the taste of food shifts toward blandness. this is why people often believe they have a taste problem. when taste is impaired problems with taste can have a big impact on an older person's life. because taste affects the amount and type of food we eat, when there are problems with taste, a person may change his or her eating habits. some people may eat too much and gain weight, while others may eat too little and lose weight. a loss of appetite, especially in older adults, can lead to loss of weight, poor nutrition, weakened immunity, and even death. taste helps us detect spoiled food or liquids and it also helps some people detect ingredients they are allergic to. a problem with taste can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted. a distorted sense of taste can be a serious risk factor for illnesses that require sticking to a specific diet. loss of taste can cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better. this can be a problem for people with such illnesses as diabetes or high blood pressure. in severe cases, loss of taste can lead to depression. taste problems are often temporary when an older person has a problem with taste, it is often temporary and minor. true taste disorders are uncommon. when a problem with taste exists, it is usually caused by medications, disease, some cancer treatments, or injury. many older people believe that there is nothing they can do about their weakened sense of taste. if you think you have a problem with your sense of taste, see your doctor. depending on the cause of your problem, your doctor may be able to suggest ways to regain your sense of taste or to cope with the loss of taste.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask':

increased risk of certain cancers. the major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. these include red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues; white blood cells, which fight infections; and platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. approximately 90 percent of people with fanconi anemia have impaired bone marrow function that leads to a decrease in the production of all blood cells (aplastic anemia). affected individuals experience extreme tiredness (fatigue) due to low numbers of red blood cells (anemia), frequent infections due to low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting problems due to low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia). people with fanconi anemia may also develop myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. more than half of people with fanconi anemia have physical abnormalities. these abnormalities can involve irregular skin coloring such as unusually light-colored skin (hypopigmentation) or caf-au-lait spots, which are flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area. other possible symptoms of fanconi anemia include malformed thumbs or forearms and other skeletal problems including short stature; malformed or absent kidneys and other defects of the urinary tract; gastrointestinal abnormalities; heart defects; eye abnormalities such as small or abnormally shaped eyes; and malformed ears and hearing loss. people with this condition may have abnormal genitalia or malformations of the reproductive system. as a result, most affected males and about half of affected females cannot have biological children (are infertile). additional signs and symptoms can include abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord

proteins produced from these genes are involved in a cell process known as the fa pathway. the fa pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of dna, called dna replication, is blocked due to dna damage. the fa pathway sends certain proteins to the area of damage, which trigger dna repair so dna replication can continue. the fa pathway is particularly responsive to a certain type of dna damage known as interstrand cross-links (icls). icls occur when two dna building blocks (nucleotides) on opposite strands of dna are abnormally attached or linked together, which stops the process of dna replication. icls can be caused by a buildup of toxic substances produced in the body or by treatment with certain cancer therapy drugs. eight proteins associated with fanconi anemia group together to form a complex known as the fa core complex. the fa core complex activates two proteins, called fancd2 and fanci. the activation of these two proteins brings dna repair proteins to the area of the icl so the cross-link can be removed and dna replication can continue. eighty to 90 percent of cases of fanconi anemia are due to mutations in one of three genes, fanca, fancc, and fancg. these genes provide instructions for producing components of the fa core complex. mutations in any of the many genes associated with the fa core complex will cause the complex to be nonfunctional and disrupt the entire fa pathway. as a result, dna damage is not repaired efficiently and icls build up over time. the icls stall dna replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability make new dna molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of dna repair processes. cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. the death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of fanconi anemia. when the buildup of errors

septo-optic dysplasia ?<answer>septo-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain development. although its signs and symptoms vary, this condition is traditionally defined by three characteristic features: underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the optic nerves, abnormal formation of structures along the midline of the brain, and pituitary hypoplasia. the first major feature, optic nerve hypoplasia, is the underdevelopment of the optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain. in affected individuals, the optic nerves are abnormally small and make fewer connections than usual between the eyes and the brain. as a result, people with optic nerve hypoplasia have impaired vision in one or both eyes. optic nerve hypoplasia can also be associated with unusual side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other eye abnormalities. the second characteristic feature of septo-optic dysplasia is the abnormal development of structures separating the right and left halves of the brain. these structures include the corpus callosum, which is a band of tissue that connects the two halves of the brain, and the septum pellucidum, which separates the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles in the brain. in the early stages of brain development, these structures may form abnormally or fail to develop at all. depending on which structures are affected, abnormal brain development can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems. the third major feature of this disorder is pituitary hypoplasia. the pituitary is a gland at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. these hormones help control growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. underdevelopment of the pituitary can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of many essential hormones. most commonly, pituitary hypoplasia causes growth hormone deficiency, which results in slow growth and unusually short stature. severe cases cause panhypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary produces no hormones. panhypopituitarism is associated with slow growth, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), genital abnormalities, and problems with sexual development. the signs and symptoms of septo-optic dysplasia can vary significantly. some researchers suggest that septo-optic dysplasia should actually be considered a group of related conditions rather than a single disorder. about one-third of people diagnosed with septo-optic dysplasia have all three major features; most affected individuals have two of the major features. in rare cases, septo-optic dysplasia

have been associated with septo-optic dysplasia, although mutations in these genes appear to be rare causes of this disorder. the three genes, hesx1, otx2, and sox2, all play important roles in

of eye cancer that usually develops in early childhood, typically before the age of 5. this form of cancer develops in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. in most children with retinoblastoma, the disease affects only one eye. however, one out of three children with retinoblastoma develops cancer in both eyes. the most common first sign of retinoblastoma is a visible whiteness in the pupil called \"cat\\'s eye reflex\" or leukocoria. this unusual whiteness is particularly noticeable in photographs taken with a flash. other signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include crossed eyes or eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus); persistent eye pain, redness, or irritation; and blindness or poor vision in the affected eye(s). retinoblastoma is often curable when it is diagnosed early. however, if it is not treated promptly, this cancer can spread beyond the eye to other parts of the body. this advanced form of retinoblastoma can be life-threatening. when retinoblastoma is associated with a gene mutation that occurs in all of the body\\'s cells, it is known as germinal retinoblastoma. people with this form of retinoblastoma also have an increased risk of developing several other cancers outside the eye. specifically, they are more likely to develop a cancer of the pineal gland in the brain (pinealoma), a type of bone cancer known as osteosarcoma, cancers of soft tissues such as muscle, and an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,

too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. most mutations in the rb1 gene prevent it from making any functional protein, so it is unable to regulate cell division effectively. as a result, certain cells in the retina can divide uncontrollably to form a cancerous tumor. some studies suggest that additional genetic changes can influence the development of retinoblastoma; these changes may help explain variations in the development and growth of tumors in different people. a small percentage of retinoblastomas are caused by deletions in the region of chromosome 13 that contains the rb1 gene. because

to the next generation. the other 60 percent of retinoblastomas are non-germinal, which means that rb1 mutations occur only in the eye and cannot be passed to the next generation. in germinal retinoblastoma, mutations in the rb1 gene appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase cancer risk. a person with germinal retinoblastoma may inherit an altered copy of the gene from one parent, or the altered gene may be the result of a new mutation that occurs in an egg or sperm cell or just after fertilization. for retinoblastoma to develop, a mutation involving the other copy of the rb1 gene must occur in retinal cells during the person's lifetime. this second

high-risk endometrial cancer after endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. the process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. a hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread. the following procedures may be used in the staging process: - pelvic exam : an exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. a speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. a pap test of the cervix is usually done. the doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. the doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. - chest x-ray : an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. an x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. - ct scan (cat scan): a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. this procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. - mri (magnetic resonance imaging): a procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (nmri). - pet scan (positron emission tomography scan): a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. - lymph node dissection : a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: - tissue. the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - lymph system. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. - blood. the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. when cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - lymph system. the cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. - blood. the cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. for example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. the disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer. the following stages are used for endometrial cancer: stage i in stage i, cancer is found in the uterus only. stage i is divided into stages ia and ib, based on how far the cancer has spread. - stage ia: cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). - stage ib: cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. stage ii in stage ii, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus. stage iii in stage iii, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. stage iii is divided into stages iiia, iiib, and iiic, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis. - stage iiia: cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus. - stage iiib: cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus). - stage iiic: cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart). stage iv in stage iv, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. stage iv is divided into stages iva and ivb, based on how far the cancer has spread. - stage iva: cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall. - stage ivb: cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin. endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows: low-risk endometrial cancer grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. they usually do not spread to other parts of the body. high-risk endometrial cancer grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. they often spread to other parts of the body. uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,

just joints, not internal organs. hands osteoarthritis of the hands seems to run in families. if your mother or grandmother has or had osteoarthritis in their hands, youre at greater-than-average risk of having it too. women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis in the hands. for most women, it develops after menopause. when osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints (those closest to the nails) of the fingers. they are called heberdens (heberr-denz) nodes. similar knobs, called bouchards (boo-shardz) nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and they may ache or be stiff and numb. the base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis. knees the knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis. symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability. hips the hips are also common sites of osteoarthritis. as with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. but sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. osteoarthritis of the hip may limit moving and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge. spine osteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. in some cases, arthritis-related changes in the spine can cause pressure on the nerves where they exit the spinal column, resulting in weakness, tingling, or numbness of the arms and legs. in severe cases, this can even affect bladder and bowel function.<end>'}\n{'input_ids':

can make it hard to be in dry places, such as on an airplane. tears and eye health tears are necessary for overall eye health and clear vision. the eye constantly makes tears to bathe, nourish, and protect the cornea. the cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer surface that covers the eye in front of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. the eye also makes tears in response to emergencies, such as a particle of dust in the eye, an infection or irritation of the eye, or an onset of strong emotions. tears keep the eye moist, and wash away dust and debris. they also help protect the eye from infections. tears are made of proteins (including growth factors), body salts, and vitamins that maintain the health of the eye surface and prevent infection. tear components tears have three major components. - an outer, oily, fat layer produced by the meibomian glands (located in the eyelids) - a middle, watery, layer produced by the lacrimal glands (located just above the upper, outer corner of the eye) - an inner, mucous layer produced by goblet cells (located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the conjunctiva). an outer, oily, fat layer produced by the meibomian glands (located in the eyelids) a middle, watery, layer produced by the lacrimal glands (located just above the upper, outer corner of the eye) an inner, mucous layer produced by goblet cells (located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the

eye there are two types of dry eye: aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. aqueous tear-deficient dry eye is a disorder in which the tear glands do not produce enough of the watery component of tears to maintain a healthy cornea. evaporative dry eye may result from inflammation of the meibomian glands, located in the eyelids. these glands make the oily part of tears that slows evaporation and keeps the tears stable. most people with dry eye will not have serious problems, but severe dry eye may lead to inflammation, ulcers, or scars on the cornea, and some loss of vision.

another kind of smell disorder. in some cases, your doctor may need to perform a nasal examination with a nasal endoscope, an instrument that illuminates and magnifies the areas of the nose where the

sense of smell helps us enjoy life. we delight in the aromas of our favorite foods or the fragrance of flowers. our sense of smell also is a warning system, alerting us to danger signals such as a gas leak, spoiled food, or a fire. any loss in our sense of smell can have a negative effect on our quality of life. it also can be a sign of more serious health problems. aging and smell loss problems with smell increase as people get older, and they are more common in men than women. in one study, nearly one-quarter of men ages 6069 had a smell disorder, while about 11 percent of women in that age range reported a problem. many older people are not even aware that they have a problem with their sense of smell because the changes occur gradually over several years. they may not even notice that they are experiencing a loss of smell until there is an incident in which they don't detect food that has spoiled or the presence of dangerous smoke. how our sense of smell works the sense of smell, or olfaction, is part of our chemical sensing system, along with the sense of taste. normal smell occurs when odors around us, like the fragrance of flowers or the smell of baking bread, stimulate the specialized sensory cells, called olfactory sensory cells. olfactory sensory cells are located in a small patch of tissue high inside the nose. odors reach the olfactory sensory cells in two pathways. the first pathway is by inhaling, or sniffing, through your nose. when people think about smell, they generally think of this pathway. the second pathway is less familiar. it is a channel that connects the roof of the throat region to the nose. when we chew our food, aromas are released that access olfactory sensory cells through this channel. if you are congested due to a head cold or sinus infection, this channel is blocked, which temporarily affects your ability to appreciate the flavors of food. types of smell disorders people who experience smell disorders either have a decrease in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors. total smell loss is relatively rare, but a decrease in the sense of smell occurs more often, especially in older adults. a decreased sense of smell may be temporary and treatable with medication. there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected. - some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced. - other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia. - sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. - still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia. - smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia. some people have hyposmia, which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced. other people can't detect odor at all, which is called anosmia. sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors. this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia. familiar odors may become distorted, or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul. still others may perceive a smell that isn't present at all, which is called phantosmia. smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia. smell loss may signal other conditions problems with our chemical senses may be a sign of other serious health conditions. a smell disorder can be an early sign of parkinsons disease, alzheimers disease, or multiple sclerosis. it can also be related to other medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and malnutrition. getting a diagnosis early will help an individual deal better with the underlying condition or disease. smell and taste smell and taste are closely linked in the brain, but are actually distinct sensory systems. true tastes are detected by taste buds on the tongue and the roof of the mouth, as well as in the throat region, and are limited to sweet, salty, sour, bitter, savory and perhaps a few other sensations. the loss of smell is much more common than the loss of taste, and many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste, when they are really experiencing a problem with their sense of smell. a loss in taste or smell is diagnosed by your doctor using special taste and smell tests. smell loss and eating habits when smell is impaired, people usually have problems appreciating the subtle flavors of food, and say that food is less enjoyable. some people change their eating habits. some may eat too little and lose weight while others may eat too much and gain weight. either way, there may be a long-term impact on one's overall health. loss of smell may also cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better. this can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. in severe cases, loss of smell can lead to depression. hazards of smell loss research shows that people with a total or partial loss of smell are almost twice as likely as people with normal smell to have certain kinds of accidents. the most common types of accidents in order of frequency involve - cooking - eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances - failing to detect gas leaks or fires cooking eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances failing to detect gas leaks or fires if you think you have a problem with

the first signs of the disorder may be behavioral problems and increasing difficulty with schoolwork. progression of the disorder is slower than in the late infantile form, and affected individuals may survive for about 20 years after diagnosis. the adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy affects approximately 15 to 20 percent of individuals with the disorder. in this form, the first symptoms appear during the teenage years or later. often behavioral problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, or difficulties at school or work are the first symptoms to appear. the affected individual may experience psychiatric symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. people with the adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy may survive for 20 to 30 years after diagnosis. during this time there may be some periods of relative stability and other periods of more rapid decline. metachromatic leukodystrophy gets its name from the way cells with an accumulation of sulfatides appear when viewed

or physical illnesses, including alcohol or substance abuse, which may mask anxiety symptoms or make them worse. in older adults, anxiety disorders often occur at the same time as depression, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical problems. in some cases, these other problems need to be treated before a person can respond well to treatment for anxiety. there are three types of anxiety disorders discussed here. - generalized anxiety disorder - social phobia - panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder (gad) all of us worry about things like health, money, or family problems. but people with generalized anxiety disorder (gad) are extremely worried about these and many other things, even when there is little or no reason to worry about them. they are very anxious about just getting through the day. they think things will always go badly. at times, worrying keeps people with gad from doing everyday tasks. learn more about generalized anxiety disorder (gad). social phobia in social phobia, a person fears being judged by others or of being embarrassed. this fear can get in the way of doing everyday things such as going to work, running errands, or meeting with friends. people who have social phobia often know that they shouldn't be so afraid, but they can't control their fear. learn more about social phobia. panic disorder in panic disorder, a person has sudden, unexplained attacks of terror, and often feels his or her heart pounding. during a panic attack, a person feels a sense of unreality, a fear of impending doom, or a fear of losing control. panic attacks can occur at any time. learn more about panic disorder. anxiety disorders are treatable in general, anxiety disorders are treated with medication, specific types of psychotherapy, or both. treatment choices depend on the type of disorder, the persons preference, and the expertise of the doctor. if you think you have an anxiety disorder, talk to your doctor.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text':

\"<question>what is (are) primary sclerosing cholangitis ?<answer>primary sclerosing cholangitis is a condition that affects the bile ducts. these ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps to digest fats) from the liver, where bile is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small intestine, where it aids in digestion. primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs because of inflammation in the bile ducts (cholangitis) that leads to scarring (sclerosis) and narrowing of the ducts. as a result, bile cannot be released to the gallbladder and small intestine, and it builds up in the liver. primary sclerosing cholangitis is usually diagnosed around age 40, and for unknown reasons, it affects men twice as often as women. many people have no signs or symptoms of the condition when they are diagnosed, but routine blood tests reveal liver problems. when apparent, the earliest signs and symptoms of primary sclerosing cholangitis include extreme tiredness (fatigue), discomfort in the abdomen, and severe itchiness (pruritus). as the condition worsens, affected individuals may develop yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). eventually, the buildup of bile damages the liver cells, causing chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) and liver failure. without bile available to digest them, fats pass through the body. as a result, weight loss and shortages of vitamins that are absorbed with and stored in fats (fat-soluble vitamins) can occur. a fat-soluble vitamin called vitamin d helps absorb calcium and helps bones harden, and lack of this vitamin can cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis. primary sclerosing cholangitis is often associated with another condition called inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by inflammation of the intestines that causes open sores (ulcers) in the intestines and abdominal pain. however, the reason for this link is unclear. approximately 70 percent of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have inflammatory bowel disease, most commonly a form of the condition known as ulcerative colitis. in addition, people with primary sclerosing cholangitis are more likely to have an autoimmune disorder, such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or thyroid disease, than people without the condition. autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma).<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text':

the signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. the hallmark feature of joubert syndrome is a brain abnormality called the molar tooth sign, which can be seen on brain imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (mri). this sign results from the abnormal development of regions near the back of the brain called the cerebellar vermis and the brainstem. the molar tooth sign got its name because the characteristic brain abnormalities resemble the cross-section of a molar tooth when seen on an mri. most infants with joubert syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy, which evolves into difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) in early childhood. other characteristic features of the condition include episodes of unusually fast or slow breathing in infancy and abnormal eye movements. most affected individuals have delayed development and intellectual disability, which range from mild to severe. distinctive facial features are also characteristic of joubert syndrome; these include a broad forehead, arched eyebrows, droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes, low-set ears, and a triangle-shaped mouth. joubert syndrome can include a broad range of additional signs and symptoms. the condition is sometimes associated with other eye abnormalities (such as retinal dystrophy, which can cause vision

and the type of urinary infection. because no single test can tell everything about the urinary tract that might be important, more than one of the tests listed below may be needed. - kidney and bladder ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show certain abnormalities in the kidneys and bladder. however, this test cannot reveal all important urinary abnormalities or measure how well the kidneys work. - voiding cystourethrogram. this test is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. the childs bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. the x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the child urinates. the procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. this test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder. the test can also determine whether the flow of urine is normal when the bladder empties. - computerized tomography (ct) scan. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-d) images. a ct scan may include the injection of contrast medium. ct scans require the child to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. ct scans can provide clearer, more detailed images to help the health care provider understand the problem. - magnetic resonance imaging (mri). mri machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. an mri may include the injection of contrast medium. with most mri machines, the child lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the child to lie in a more open space. the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed, though light sedation may be used for children with a fear of confined spaces. like ct scans, mris can provide clearer, more detailed images. - radionuclide scan. a radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. radionuclide scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. radioactive chemicals injected into the blood can provide information about kidney function. radioactive chemicals can also be put into the fluids used to fill the bladder and urethra for x ray, mri, and ct imaging. radionuclide scans expose a child to about the same amount or less of radiation as a conventional x ray. - urodynamics. urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. most of these tests are performed in the office of a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problemsby a urologist, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. some procedures may require light sedation to keep the child calm. most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. urodynamic tests can also show whether the bladder is having abnormal contractions that cause leakage. a health care provider may order these tests if there is evidence that the child has some kind of nerve damage or dysfunctional voidingunhealthy urination habits such as holding in urine when the bladder is full.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]),

organs via the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, ovaries, and testes. a pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the pituitary gland. most pituitary tumors are benign, which means they are non-cancerous, grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body; however they can make the pituitary gland produce either too many or too few hormones, which can cause problems in the body. tumors that make hormones are called functioning tumors, and they can cause a wide array of symptoms depending upon the hormone affected. tumors that dont make hormones are called non-functioning

the pituitary gland, a pea-sized organ in the center of the brain, just above the back of the nose. the pituitary gland is sometimes called the \"master endocrine gland\" because it makes hormones that affect the way many parts of the body work. it also controls hormones made by many other glands in the body. pituitary tumors are divided into three groups: - benign pituitary adenomas: tumors that are not cancer. these tumors grow very slowly and do not spread from the pituitary gland to other parts of the body. - invasive pituitary adenomas: benign tumors that may spread to bones of the skull or the sinus cavity below the pituitary gland. - pituitary carcinomas: tumors that are malignant (cancer). these pituitary tumors spread into other areas of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or outside of the central nervous system. very few pituitary tumors are malignant. pituitary tumors may be either non-functioning or functioning. - non-functioning pituitary tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. - functioning pituitary tumors make more than the normal amount of one or more hormones. most pituitary tumors are functioning tumors. the extra hormones made by pituitary tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease. the pituitary gland hormones control many other glands in the body. hormones made by the pituitary gland include: - prolactin: a hormone that causes a womans breasts to make milk during and after pregnancy. - adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth): a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to make a hormone called cortisol. cortisol helps control the use of sugar, protein, and fats in the body and helps the body deal with stress. - growth hormone: a hormone that helps control body growth and the use of sugar and fat in the body. growth hormone is also called somatotropin. - thyroid-stimulating hormone: a hormone that causes the thyroid gland to make other hormones that control growth, body temperature, and heart rate. thyroid-stimulating hormone is also called thyrotropin. - luteinizing hormone (lh) and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh): hormones that control the menstrual cycle in women and the making of sperm in

the abdominal area will show whether symptoms are due to an intestinal blockage. - upper gi series. a health care provider may order an upper gi series to look at the small intestine. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images; the health care provider may give infants and children anesthesia. a person should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. during the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. infants lie on a table and the technician will give them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. barium coats the lining of the small intestine, making signs of obstruction show up more clearly on x rays. a person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. barium liquid in the gi tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. a health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. - lower gi series. a health care provider may order a lower gi series, an x-ray exam to look at the large intestine. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. a person does not need anesthesia. the health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. the health care provider may ask the person to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. a person may need to use a laxative or an enema before the test. a laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. an enema involves flushing water or laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle. for the test, the person will lie on a table while the health care provider inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. the health care provider will fill the large intestine with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. the test can show problems with the large intestine that are causing the persons symptoms. barium liquid in the gi tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. a health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. - computerized tomography (ct) scan. ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. an x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. for a ct scan, a health care provider may give the person a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. ct scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays. ct scans can show both the internal and external intestinal wall. the health care provider may give children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test. - upper gi endoscopy. this procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. a gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. the gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. a health care provider may give a person a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the persons throat. a health care provider will place an intravenous (iv) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. this test can show blockages or other conditions in the upper small intestine. a gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsy of the lining of the small intestine during an upper gi endoscopy. biopsy a gastroenterologist can obtain a biopsy of the intestinal wall during endoscopy or during surgery, if the person has surgery for intestinal pseudo-obstruction and the cause is unknown. if the health care provider needs to examine the nerves in the intestinal wall, a deeper biopsy, which a gastroenterologist can typically obtain only during surgery, is necessary. a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of the intestinal wall tissue for examination with a microscope. a health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital and uses light sedation and local anesthetic; the health care provider uses general anesthesia if performing the biopsy during surgery. a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the intestinal tissue in a lab. diagnosing problems in the nerve pathways of the intestinal tissue requires special techniques that are not widely available. a health care provider can also use a biopsy obtained during endoscopy to rule out celiac disease. celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in products such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and certain medications. blood tests a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show the presence of other diseases or conditions that may be causing a persons symptoms. the blood test also can show levels of essential vitamins and minerals to help detect malnutrition. manometry manometry is a test that measures muscle pressure and movements in the gi tract, such as how well the smooth muscles of the stomach and small intestine contract and relax. a gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. while the person is under sedation, a health care provider places a thin tube, or manometry tube, into the stomach and moves it down into the small intestine. a gastroenterologist may use an endoscope to place this tube. a health care provider will move the person to a manometry room and connect the manometry tube to a computer. when the person wakes up from sedation, the computer records the pressure inside the intestine while the person is fasting and after the person has eaten a meal. manometry can confirm the diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction and show the extent of the condition. gastric emptying tests gastric emptying tests can show if a disorder called gastroparesis is causing a persons symptoms. people with gastroparesis, which literally refers to a paralyzed stomach, have severely delayed gastric emptying, or the delayed movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. some patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction also have gastroparesis. types of gastric emptying tests include the following: - gastric emptying scintigraphy. this test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. a specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the results; the person does not need anesthesia. an external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. the radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. normal values depend on the composition of the meal. with some meals, if more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, a health care provider confirms the diagnosis of gastroparesis. obtaining scans for 4 hours after the meal is essential. when the technician only obtains scans 1 to 2 hours after the meal, the results are often unreliable. - breath test. with this test, the person eats a meal containing a small amount of nonradioactive material. then, the health care provider takes breath samples over a period of several hours to measure the amount of nonradioactive material in the exhaled breath. the results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying. - smartpill. the smartpill is a small electronic device in capsule form. the smartpill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. the person swallows the device so that it can move through the entire digestive tract and send information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck. the recorded information provides details about how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ..., 10081,   876,   284]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 1, 1,

and likelihood of developing a disease. sometimes, it's not clear what causes a disease. many diseases are thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. the importance of any particular factor varies from person to person. if you have a disease, does that mean your children and grandchildren will get it, too? not necessarily. they may have a greater chance of developing the disease than someone without a similar family history. but they are not certain to get the disease. (watch the video to learn more about why family health history is important. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) health problems that may run in families common health problems that can run in a family include: - alzheimer's disease/dementia - arthritis - asthma - blood clots - cancer - depression - diabetes - heart disease - high cholesterol - high blood pressure - pregnancy losses and birth defects - stroke. alzheimer's disease/dementia arthritis asthma blood clots cancer depression diabetes heart disease high cholesterol high blood pressure pregnancy losses and birth defects stroke. learn more about the importance of family history in some of these health problems at diseases, genetics and family history. (center for disease control and prevention) heritable diseases some diseases are clearly heritable. this means the disease comes from a mutation, or harmful change, in a gene inherited from one or both parents. genes are small structures in your body's cells that determine how you look and tell your body how to work. examples of heritable diseases are huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. learn basic information about chromosomes. learn basic information about dna. role of lifestyle and environment genes are not the only things that cause disease. lifestyle habits and environment also play a major part in developing disease. diet, weight, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, occupation, and where you live can each increase or decrease disease risk. for example, smoking increases the chance of developing heart disease and cancer. for common diseases like heart disease and cancer, habits like smoking or drinking too much alcohol may be more important in causing disease than genes. sun exposure is the major known environmental factor associated with the development of skin cancer of all types. however, other environmental and genetic factors can also increase a persons risk. the best defense against skin cancer is to encourage sun-protective behaviors, regular skin examinations, and skin self-awareness in an effort to decrease high-risk behaviors and optimize early detection of problems. learn more about the causes and risk factors for skin cancer. clues to your disease risk creating a family health history helps you know about diseases and disease risks. it can also show the way a disease occurs in a family. for example, you may find that a family member had a certain disease at an earlier age than usual (10 to 20 years before most people get it). that can increase other family members' risk. risk also goes up if a relative has a disease that usually does not affect a certain gender, for example, breast cancer in a man. certain combinations of diseases within a family -- such as breast and ovarian cancer, or heart disease and diabetes -- also increase the chance of developing those diseases. some risk factors are not apparent even if they appear healthy, people could be at risk for developing a serious disease that runs in the family. they could have risk factors that they cannot feel, such as high blood pressure. they might not even know the disease runs in their family because they've lost touch with family members with the disease or because other family members with the disease have kept the information private. another possibility is that family members who might have developed the disease died young in accidents or by other means. they might also be adopted and not share genes with members of their adoptive family. getting professional advice family members who think they might be at risk for a disease based on their family health history can ask their health care professionals for advice. the professional may order a test to see if the person has the disease or a risk factor for the disease. for instance, a mammogram can detect possible breast cancer, and a colonoscopy can find colon cancer. many diseases are more treatable if they are caught early. the first step toward better understanding of your family's health is to learn more about the health of close relatives such as parents, brothers and sisters, and children. creating a family health history is one way to do that.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  8727,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]),

dizziness, or fainting associated with blood pressure and circulation problems. raising the head of the bed or wearing elastic stockings may also help. some people benefit from increased salt in the diet and treatment with salt-retaining hormones. others benefit from high blood pressure medications. physical therapy can help when muscle weakness or loss of coordination is a problem. urinary and sexual problems to clear up a urinary tract infection, the doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic. drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection. people who have incontinence should try to urinate at regular intervalsevery 3 hours, for examplebecause they may not be able to tell when the bladder is full. to treat erectile dysfunction in men, the doctor will first do tests to rule out a hormonal cause. several methods are available to treat erectile dysfunction caused by neuropathy. medicines are available to help men have and maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis. some are oral medications and others are injected into the penis or inserted into the urethra at the tip of the penis. mechanical vacuum devices can also increase blood flow to the penis. another option is to surgically implant an inflatable or semirigid device in the penis. vaginal lubricants may be useful for women when neuropathy causes vaginal dryness. to treat problems with arousal and orgasm, the doctor may refer women to a gynecologist. foot care people with neuropathy need to take special care of their feet. the nerves to the feet are the longest in the body and are the ones most often affected by neuropathy. loss of sensation in the feet means that sores or injuries may not be noticed and may become ulcerated or infected. circulation problems also increase the risk of foot ulcers. smoking increases the risk of foot problems and amputation. a health care provider may be able to provide help with quitting smoking. more than 60 percent of all nontraumatic lower-limb amputations in the united states occur in people with diabetes. nontraumatic amputations are those not caused by trauma such as severe injuries from an accident. in 2004, about 71,000 nontraumatic amputations were performed in people with diabetes. comprehensive foot care programs can reduce amputation rates by 45 to 85 percent. careful foot care involves - cleaning the feet daily using warmnot hotwater and a mild soap. soaking the feet should be avoided. a soft towel can be used to dry the feet and between the toes. - inspecting the feet and toes every day for cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, calluses, or other problems. using a mirrorhandheld or placed on the floormay be helpful in checking the bottoms of the feet, or another person can help check the feet. a health care provider should be notified of any problems. - using lotion to moisturize the feet. getting lotion between the toes should be avoided. - filing corns and calluses gently with a pumice stone after a bath or shower. - cutting toenails to the shape of the toes and filing the edges with an emery board each week or when needed. - always wearing shoes or slippers to protect feet from injuries. wearing thick, soft, seamless socks can prevent skin irritation. - wearing shoes that fit well and allow the toes to move. new shoes can be broken in gradually by first wearing them for only an hour at a time. - looking shoes over carefully before putting them on and feeling the insides to make sure the shoes are free of tears, sharp edges, or objects that might injure the feet. people who need help taking care of their feet should consider making an appointment to see a foot doctor, also called a podiatrist.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ...,   618,  7669, 16786]),

the basis of symptoms and a physical exam. during the exam, the doctor may check blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensitivity to position changes, vibration, temperature, or light touch. foot exams experts recommend that people with diabetes have a comprehensive foot exam each year to check for peripheral neuropathy. people diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy need more frequent foot exams. a comprehensive foot exam assesses the skin, muscles, bones, circulation, and sensation of the feet. the doctor may assess protective sensation or feeling in the feet by touching them with a nylon monofilamentsimilar to a bristle on a hairbrushattached to a wand or by pricking them with a pin. people who cannot sense pressure from a pinprick or monofilament have lost protective sensation and are at risk for developing foot sores that may not heal properly. the doctor may also check temperature perception or use a tuning fork, which is more sensitive than touch pressure, to assess vibration perception. other tests the doctor may perform other tests as part of the diagnosis. - nerve conduction studies or electromyography are sometimes used to help determine the type and extent of nerve damage. nerve conduction studies check the transmission of electrical current through a nerve. electromyography shows how well muscles respond to electrical signals transmitted by nearby nerves. these tests are rarely needed to diagnose neuropathy. - a check of heart rate variability shows how the heart responds to deep breathing and to changes in blood pressure and posture. - ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of internal organs. an ultrasound of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, for example, can be used to assess the structure of these organs and show whether the bladder empties completely after urination.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,

genetic changes related to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ?<answer>mutations in the adamts13 gene cause the familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. the adamts13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the normal process of blood clotting. mutations in this gene lead to a severe reduction in the activity of this enzyme. the acquired form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura also results from a reduction in adamts13 enzyme activity; however, people with the acquired form do not have mutations in the adamts13 gene. instead, their immune systems often produce specific proteins called autoantibodies that block the activity of the enzyme. a lack of adamts13 enzyme activity disrupts the usual balance between bleeding and clotting. normally, blood clots form at the site of an injury to seal off damaged blood vessels and prevent excess blood loss. in people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, clots form throughout the body as platelets bind together abnormally and stick to the walls of blood vessels. these clots can block small blood vessels, causing organ damage and the other features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic

is a rare blood disorder. in ttp, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. the clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body\\'s organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. as a result, serious health problems can develop. the increased clotting that occurs in ttp also uses up platelets (plate-lets) in the blood. platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. these cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. with fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. people who have ttp may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. when cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal. \"thrombotic\" (throm-bot-ik) refers to the blood clots that form. \"thrombocytopenic\" (throm-bo-cy-toe-pee-nick) means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. \"purpura\" (purr-purr-ah) refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin. bleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. these pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-tee-kee-ay). petechiae may look like a rash. purpura and petechiae ttp also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. this leads to hemolytic anemia (hee-moh-lit-ick uh-nee-me-uh)a rare form of anemia. anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. a lack of activity in the adamts13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes ttp. the adamts13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting. the enzyme breaks up a large protein called von willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots. types of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura the two main types of ttp are inherited and acquired. \"inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. this type of ttp mainly affects newborns and children. in inherited ttp, the adamts13 gene is faulty and doesn\\'t prompt the body to make a normal adamts13 enzyme. as a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed. acquired ttp is the more common type of the disorder. \"acquired\" means you aren\\'t born with the disorder, but you develop it. this type of ttp mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children. in acquired ttp, the adamts13 gene isn\\'t faulty. instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the adamts13 enzyme. it\\'s not clear what triggers inherited and acquired ttp, but some factors may play a role. these factors may include: some diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, hiv, lupus, and infections some medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant some medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine a, and hormone therapy and estrogens quinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products if you have ttp, you may sometimes hear it referred to as ttphus. hus, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is a disorder that resembles ttp, but is more common in children. kidney problems also tend to be worse in hus. although some researchers think ttp and hus are two forms of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that each has different causes. outlook ttp is a rare disorder. it can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it\\'s not treated right away. ttp usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can continue for months. relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of ttp. many people who have inherited ttp have frequent flareups that need to be treated. treatments for ttp include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis (plaz-ma-feh-re-sis). these treatments have greatly improved the outlook of the disorder.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>how many people are

genetic changes related to sickle cell disease ?<answer>mutations in the hbb gene cause sickle cell disease. hemoglobin consists of four protein subunits, typically, two subunits called alpha-globin and two subunits called beta-globin. the hbb gene provides instructions for making beta-globin. various versions of beta-globin result from different mutations in the hbb gene. one particular hbb gene mutation produces an abnormal version of beta-globin known as hemoglobin s (hbs). other mutations in the hbb gene lead to additional abnormal versions of beta-globin such as hemoglobin c (hbc) and hemoglobin e (hbe). hbb gene mutations can also result in an unusually low level of beta-globin; this abnormality is called beta thalassemia. in people with sickle cell disease, at least one of the beta-globin subunits in hemoglobin is replaced with hemoglobin s. in sickle cell anemia, which is a common form of sickle cell disease, hemoglobin s replaces both beta-globin subunits in hemoglobin. in other types of sickle cell disease, just one beta-globin subunit in hemoglobin is replaced with hemoglobin s. the other beta-globin subunit is replaced with a different abnormal variant, such as hemoglobin c. for example, people with sickle-hemoglobin c (hbsc) disease have hemoglobin molecules with hemoglobin s and hemoglobin c instead of beta-globin. if mutations that produce hemoglobin s and beta thalassemia occur together, individuals have hemoglobin s-beta thalassemia (hbsbetathal) disease. abnormal versions of beta-globin can distort red blood cells into a sickle shape. the sickle-shaped red blood cells die prematurely, which can lead to anemia. sometimes the inflexible, sickle-shaped cells get stuck in small blood vessels and can cause serious medical

sickle cell disease ?<answer>espaol the term sickle cell disease (scd) describes a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. people with scd have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin s or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells. hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. inherited means that the disease is passed by genes from parents to their children. scd is not contagious. a person cannot catch it, like a cold or infection, from someone else. people who have scd inherit two abnormal hemoglobin genes, one from each parent. in all forms of scd, at least one of the two abnormal genes causes a persons body to make hemoglobin s. when a person has two hemoglobin s genes, hemoglobin ss, the disease is called sickle cell anemia. this is the most common and often most severe kind of scd. hemoglobin sc disease and hemoglobin s thalassemia (thal-uh-see-me-uh) are two other common forms of scd. some forms of sickle cell disease hemoglobin ss hemoglobin sc hemoglobin s0 thalassemia hemoglobin s+ thalassemia hemoglobin sd hemoglobin se overview cells in tissues need a steady supply of oxygen to work well. normally, hemoglobin in red blood cells takes up oxygen in the lungs and carries it to all the tissues of the body. red blood cells that contain normal hemoglobin are disc shaped (like a doughnut without a hole). this shape allows the cells to be flexible so that they can move through large and small blood vessels to deliver oxygen. sickle hemoglobin is not like normal hemoglobin. it can form stiff rods within the red cell, changing it into a crescent, or sickle shape. sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and can stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. when this happens, oxygen cant reach nearby tissues. normal red cells and sickle red cells the lack of tissue oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. these pain attacks can occur without warning, and a person often needs to go to the hospital for effective treatment. most children with scd are pain free between painful crises, but adolescents and adults may also suffer with chronic ongoing pain. the red cell sickling and poor oxygen delivery can also cause organ damage. over a lifetime, scd can harm a persons spleen, brain, eyes, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, penis, joints, bones, or skin. sickle cells cant change shape easily, so they tend to burst apart or hemolyze. normal red blood cells live about 90 to 120 days, but sickle cells last only 10 to 20 days. the body is always making new red blood cells to replace the old cells; however, in scd the body may have trouble keeping up with how fast the cells are being destroyed. because of this, the number of red blood cells is usually lower than normal. this condition, called anemia, can make a person have less energy. outlook sickle cell disease is a life-long illness. the severity of the disease varies widely from person to person. in high-income countries like the united states, the life expectancy of a person with scd is now about 4060 years. in 1973, the average lifespan of a person with scd in the united states was only 14 years. advances in the diagnosis and care of scd have made this improvement possible. at the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) is the only cure for scd. unfortunately, most people with scd are either too old for a transplant or dont have a relative who is a good enough genetic match for them to act as a donor. a well-matched donor is needed to have the best chance for a successful transplant. there are effective treatments that can reduce symptoms and prolong life. early diagnosis and regular medical care to prevent complications also contribute to improved well-being.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>how

african-american men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. hormones the prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. the main male sex hormone is testosterone. testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (dht) by an enzyme in the body. dht is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention

lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. these drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (dht). higher than normal levels of dht may play a part in developing prostate cancer. taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. the prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. the number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events trial (reduce) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. the number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: selenium and vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) studied whether taking vitamin e and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. the selenium and vitamin e were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for african-american men). the study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin e together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. diet it is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. in the pcpt trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. multivitamins regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. however, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. lycopene some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. it has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci website. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for prostate cancer prevention trials that are accepting patients.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ...,  1342,  8361, 26711]),

patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. - six types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - photodynamic therapy - biologic therapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. different types of treatment are available for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. six types of standard treatment are used: surgery one or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis: - mohs micrographic surgery: the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. during surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. this type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove skin cancer on the face. - simple excision: the tumor is cut from the skin along with some of the normal skin around it. - shave excision: the abnormal area is shaved off the surface of the skin with a small blade. - electrodesiccation and curettage: the tumor is cut from the skin with a curette (a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). a needle-shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound. the process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer. - cryosurgery: a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as carcinoma in situ. this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. - laser surgery: a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. - dermabrasion: removal of the top layer of skin using a rotating wheel or small particles to rub away skin cells. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat skin cancer. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). chemotherapy for nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis is usually topical (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the condition being treated. retinoids (drugs related to vitamin a) are sometimes used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. photodynamic therapy photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. a drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. the drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. for skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. interferon and imiquimod are biologic agents used to treat skin cancer. interferon (by injection) may be used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. topical imiquimod therapy (a cream applied to the skin) may be used to treat some small basal cell carcinomas. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. targeted therapy with a signal transduction inhibitor is used to treat basal cell carcinoma. signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. vismodegib and sonidegib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat basal cell carcinoma. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are likely to recur (come back), usually within 5 years, or new tumors may form. talk to your doctor about how often you should have your skin checked for signs of cancer. treatment options for nonmelanoma skin cancer basal cell carcinoma treatment of basal cell carcinoma may include the following: - simple excision. - mohs micrographic surgery. - radiation therapy. - electrodesiccation and curettage. - cryosurgery. - photodynamic therapy. - topical chemotherapy. - topical biologic therapy with imiquimod. - laser

genetic changes related to lung cancer ?<answer>cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged dna. these changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. in nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. these changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. mutations in the egfr and kras genes are estimated to be present in up to half of all lung cancer cases. these genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. when these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell growth and division (proliferation). mutations in either the egfr or kras gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). as a result, cells are signaled to constantly proliferate, leading to tumor formation. when these gene changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops. mutations in many other genes have each been found in a small proportion of cases. in addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. the greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 20-fold. other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. a history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer were likely smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk of

controls movement become impaired and/or die. normally, these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine, but when the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine. this shortage of dopamine causes the movement problems of people with parkinson\\'s. dopamine is a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter. dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions. the connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth, purposeful movement. loss of dopamine in this circuit results in abnormal nerve-firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. loss of norepinephrine people with parkinson\\'s also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic nervous system controls many automatic functions of the body, such as heart rate and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non-movement features of parkinson\\'s, such as fatigue, irregular blood pressure, decreased gastric motility or movement of food through the digestive tract, and postural hypotension. postural hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a sitting or lying-down position. it may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and in some cases, loss of balance or fainting. lewy bodies in brain cells many brain cells of people with parkinson\\'s contain lewy bodies. lewy bodies are unusual deposits or clumps of the brain protein alpha-synuclein, along with other proteins, which are seen upon microscopic examination of the brain. researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of parkinson\\'s. the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally, or they may actually be helpful, perhaps by keeping harmful proteins \"locked up\" so the cells can function. genetic mutations although some cases of parkinson\\'s appear to be hereditary, and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations, most cases are sporadic. sporadic means the disease occurs randomly and does not seem to run in families. many researchers now believe that parkinson\\'s disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson\\'s including mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. they think that many more genes may be linked to the disorder. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson\\'s can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson\\'s. environmental toxins although researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetics in parkinson\\'s disease, most believe environmental exposures increase a person\\'s risk of developing the disease. even in inherited cases, exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans. researchers are pursuing the question of whether pesticides and other environmental factors not yet identified also may cause parkinson\\'s disease. viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson\\'s. mitochondria and free radicals research suggests that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson\\'s disease. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals. free radicals are molecules that damage membranes, proteins, dna, and other parts of the cell. this damage is called oxidative stress. changes to brain cells caused by oxidative stress, including free radical damage to dna, proteins, and fats, have been found in people with parkinson\\'s. clinical studies now underway test whether agents thought to improve energy metabolism and decrease oxidative stress slow the progression of parkinson\\'s disease. recent evidence suggests that mutations in genes linked to parkinsons disease result in mitochondrial dysfunction. buildup of harmful proteins other research suggests that the cell\\'s protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson\\'s, causing proteins like alpha-synuclein to build up to harmful levels and trigger premature cell death. additional studies have found that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson\\'s may contribute to the death of nerve cells, or neurons. however, the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown. these studies also found that inflammation, because of protein accumulation, toxins or other factors, may play a role in the disease. however, the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown. researchers are exploring the possibility of vaccine development to decrease or prevent the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. while mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson\\'s disease, scientists still do not know what causes cells that produce dopamine to die. genes linked to parkinsons researchers have discovered several genes that are linked to parkinson\\'s disease. the first to be identified was alpha-synuclein or snca . studies have found that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson\\'s contain clumps of alpha-synuclein protein. this discovery revealed a possible link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease. other genes linked to parkinson\\'s include park2, park7, pink1, and lrrk2. park2, park7, and pink1 cause rare, early-onset forms of the disease. mutations in the lrrk2 gene are common in specific populations, including in people with parkinson\\'s in north africa. researchers are continuing to study the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson\\'s develops. they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson\\'s, but the nature of these links is not yet clear. whole genome wide association studies, or gwas, of thousands of people with parkinson\\'s disease are now underway to find gene variants that allow for an increased risk of developing parkinson\\'s but are not necessarily causes of this disorder by themselves. a recent international study found that two genes containing mutations known to cause rare hereditary forms of parkinsons disease are also associated with the more common sporadic form of the disease. this finding came from a gwas which looked at dna samples of european people who had parkinsons disease and from those who did not have the disorder.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,  5640,  ...,  4778,   326,

symptoms. many of the symptoms of leukemia don't become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells. symptoms of chronic and acute leukemia in chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and, in the beginning, are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia. chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor's exam before symptoms are present. when symptoms appear, they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse, but sometimes they don't worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis. recently, researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis. this finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses. in acute leukemia, symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly. people with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. white blood cell levels may be high people with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells, but because the cells are abnormal, they are unable to fight infection. therefore, patients may develop frequent fevers or infections. a shortage of red blood cells, called anemia, can cause a person to feel tired. not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily. some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body. leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs, such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, or other parts of the body, including the eyes, brain, and testicles. other common symptoms other common symptoms of leukemia include headache, weight loss, pain in the bones or joints, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen), and swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit. symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, and seizures. some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases, so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia. it is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms. only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia. diagnosing leukemia: physical exam, blood tests, biopsy to find the cause of leukemia symptoms, the doctor will ask about medical history and conduct a physical exam. during the exam, the doctor will check for signs of disease such as lumps, swelling in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, or anything else that seems unusual. the doctor will need to do blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells. the doctor also may look at certain factors in the blood to see if leukemia has affected other organs such as the liver or kidneys. even if blood tests suggest leukemia, the doctor may look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow by doing a biopsy before making a diagnosis. a biopsy is a procedure where a small amount of bone marrow is removed from a bone. a pathologist examines the sample under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. there are two ways the doctor can obtain bone marrow. in a bone marrow aspiration, marrow is collected by inserting a needle into the hipbone or another large bone and removing a small amount of bone marrow. a bone marrow biopsy is performed with a larger needle and removes bone marrow and a small piece of bone. if leukemia cells are found if leukemia cells are found in the bone marrow sample, the doctor may perform more tests to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. the doctor may collect a sample of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord by performing a spinal tap and checking for leukemia cells or other signs of problems. computed tomography (ct) scans, and ultrasounds are tests used to determine if leukemia has spread from the bone marrow. these tests produce pictures of the inside of the body. with these tests, the doctor looks for abnormalities such as enlarged organs or signs of infection.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids':

?<answer>fractures -- a possible warning sign osteoporosis does not have any symptoms until a fracture occurs. women and men with osteoporosis most often break bones in the hip, spine, and wrist. but any fracture in an older person could be a warning sign that the bone is weaker than optimal. some people may be unaware that they have already experienced one or more spine fractures. height loss of one inch or more may be the first sign that someone has experienced spine fractures due to osteoporosis. multiple spine fractures can cause a curved spine, stooped posture, back pain, and back fatigue. women and men who have had a fracture are at high risk of experiencing another one. a fracture over the age of 50 or several fractures before that age may be a warning sign that a person has already developed osteoporosis. people over the age of 50 who have experienced a fracture should talk to their doctor about getting evaluated for osteoporosis. risk factors for fractures the more likely you are to fall, the higher your risk for a fracture. and more severe falls increase your risk for fractures. factors that increase your risk of falling and of fracturing a bone include - decreased muscle strength - poor balance - impaired eyesight - impaired mental abilities - certain medications, such as tranquilizers and muscle relaxants - hazardous elements in your living environment, such as slippery throw rugs and icy sidewalks. decreased muscle strength poor balance impaired eyesight impaired mental abilities certain medications, such as tranquilizers and muscle relaxants hazardous elements in your living environment, such as slippery throw rugs and icy sidewalks. the angle at which you fall also affects your risk of fracture. hip fractures although low bone mass (or low bone density) plays an important role in determining a person's risk of osteoporosis, it is only one of many risk factors for fractures. various aspects of bone geometry, such as tallness, hip structure, and thighbone (femur) length, can also affect your chances of breaking a bone if you fall. increasing age, too much weight loss, a history of fractures since age 50, having an existing spine fracture, and having a mother who fractured her hip all increase the risk of hip fracture regardless of a person's bone density. people with more risk factors have a higher chance of suffering a hip fracture.<end>\"}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1, 1, 1,  ..., 0, 0, 0])}\n================\n{'text': '<question>how to prevent shingles ?<answer>a vaccine for adults 60 and older in may 2006, the u.s. food and drug administration approved a vaccine (zostavax) to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. the vaccine is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. there is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. in a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. a one-time dose to reduce the risk of shingles, adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles, it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. if you have had shingles before, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. there is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. side effects vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. in most cases, shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days, such as headache or redness, soreness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given. when to get the vaccine the decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. the shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine, you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. where to get the vaccine the shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, and health departments. most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. medicare part d plans cover shingles vaccine, but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. if you do not have health insurance, visit www.healthcare.gov to learn more about health insurance options. who should not get the vaccine? you should not get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. - have a weakened immune system because of: -- hiv/aids

currently, there is no way to delay or prevent type 1 diabetes. however, research has shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in people at risk for the disease. preventing type 2 diabetes can mean a healthier and longer life without serious complications from the disease such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations. preventing type 2 diabetes before people develop type 2 diabetes, they usually have prediabetes -- a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, there are ways to reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes benefits of weight loss and exercise the diabetes prevention program (dpp) is a landmark study by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases. dpp researchers found that adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were able to cut their risk in half by losing a modest amount of weight and being active almost every day. this means losing 5 to 7 percent of body weight (that\\'s 10 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and getting 150 minutes of physical activity a week. the drug metformin reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 34 percent but was more effective in younger and heavier adults. (watch the video to learn more about preventing type 2 diabetes. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) the benefits of weight loss and regular exercise have long-lasting value. in a dpp follow-up trial known as the diabetes prevention program outcome study (dppos), people at risk of type 2 diabetes who kept off the weight they had lost and who continued to exercise regularly delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes by about 4 years. the dpp study also showed that modest weight loss (achieved by following a low calorie, low-fat diet) and moderate physical activity were especially effective in preventing or delaying the development of diabetes in older people. in fact, people over the age of 60 were able to reduce their risk for developing type 2 diabetes by 71 percent. how to lower your risk making modest lifestyle changes can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people who are at risk. here are some tips. reach and maintain a reasonable body weight your weight affects your health in many ways. being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin properly. it can also cause high blood pressure. the body mass index chart (seen here) can be used to find out whether someone is normal weight, overweight, or obese. body mass index is a measurement of body weight relative to height for adults age 20 or older. to use the chart - find the person\\'s height in the left-hand column - move across the row to find the number closest to the person\\'s weight - find the number at the top of that column - the number at the top of the column is the persons bmi. find the person\\'s height in the left-hand column move across the row to find the number closest to the person\\'s weight find the number at the top of that column the number at the top of the column is the persons bmi. the words above the bmi number indicate whether the person is normal weight, overweight, or obese. people who are overweight or obese should consider talking with a health care provider about ways to lose weight and reduce the risk of diabetes. the bmi has certain limitations. the bmi may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build and underestimate body fat in older adults and others who have lost muscle. waist measurement. in addition to weight, the location of excess fat on the body can be important. a waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance and increases a persons risk for type 2 diabetes. this is true even if a persons body mass index (bmi) falls within the normal range. to measure the waist, a person should - place a tape measure around the bare abdomen just above the hip bone - make sure the tape is snug but isnt digging into the skin and is parallel to the floor - relax, exhale, and measure. place a tape measure around the bare

impact on your weight and overall health. by developing healthy eating habits, you can help manage your body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. reducing portion size, increasing the amount of fiber you consume (by eating more fruits and vegetables) and limiting fatty and salty foods are key to a healthy diet. here are more tips for eating well with diabetes. - make a diabetes meal plan with help from your health care team. - choose foods that are lower in calories, saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, and salt. - eat foods with more fiber, such as whole grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta. - choose foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, bread and cereals, and low-fat or skim milk and cheese. - drink water instead of juice and regular soda. - when eating a meal,

blood vessel problems a health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose alagille syndrome; however, it is not necessary to make a diagnosis. a diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of jag1. the health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the jag1 gene mutation. the gene mutation can be identified in 94 percent of people with a diagnosis of alagille syndrome.2 blood test. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider\\'s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function. urinalysis. urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample. the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care provider\\'s office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems. the sample may be observed for color, cloudiness, or concentration; signs of drug use; chemical composition, including glucose; the presence of protein, blood cells, or bacteria; or other signs of disease. x ray. an x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. the amount of radiation used is small. an x-ray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. the patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. the technician positions the x-ray machine over the spine area to look for \"butterfly\" vertebrae. the patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. the patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures. abdominal ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. in abdominal ultrasound, the health care provider applies a gel to the patient\\'s abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin. the gel allows the transducer to glide easily, and it improves the transmission of the signals. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider\\'s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions. cardiology exam. a cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care provider\\'s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. during a full exam, a cardiologist may inspect the patient\\'s physical appearance, measure pulse rate and blood pressure, observe the jugular vein, check for rapid or skipped heartbeats, listen for variations in heart sounds, and listen to the lungs. slit-lamp exam. an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slit-lamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon. the ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp, a microscope combined with a high-intensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye. while sitting in a chair, the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp. a yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer. the dye is applied as a drop, or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patient\\'s eye. the specialist will also use drops in the patient\\'s eye to dilate the pupil. liver biopsy. a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. the patient may be asked to fast for 8 hours before the procedure. during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand

geneticist tests for the jag1 gene mutation first, since it is more common in alagille syndrome than notch2. genetic testing is often done only by specialized labs. the results may not be available for several months because of the complexity of the testing. the usefulness of genetic testing for alagille syndrome is limited by two factors: - detection of a mutated gene cannot predict the onset of symptoms or how serious the disorder will be. - even if a mutated gene is found, no specific cure for the disorder exists. when to consider genetic counseling people who are considering genetic testing may want to consult a genetics counselor. genetic counseling can help family members understand how test results may affect them individually and as a family. genetic counseling is provided by

individuals. people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually develop the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between ages 20 and 50. the earliest symptoms are shortness of breath following mild activity, reduced ability to exercise, and wheezing. other signs and symptoms can include unintentional weight loss, recurring respiratory infections, fatigue, and rapid heartbeat upon standing. affected individuals often develop emphysema, which is a lung disease caused by damage to the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). characteristic features of emphysema include difficulty breathing, a hacking cough, and a barrel-shaped chest. smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke accelerates the appearance of emphysema symptoms and damage to the lungs. about 10 percent of infants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease, which often causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver. signs of cirrhosis include a swollen abdomen, swollen feet or legs, and jaundice. individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. in rare cases, people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop a skin condition called panniculitis, which is characterized by hardened skin with painful lumps or patches. panniculitis varies in severity and can occur at any age.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   318,  ...,

environmental factors, many of which are unknown. studies suggest that restless legs syndrome is related to a shortage (deficiency) of iron in certain parts of the brain. iron is involved in several critical activities in brain cells, including the production of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. among its many functions, dopamine triggers signals within the nervous system that help the brain control physical movement. researchers believe that malfunction of the dopamine signaling system may underlie the abnormal movements in people with restless legs syndrome. however, it is unclear how iron deficiency is related to abnormal dopamine signaling, or how these changes in the brain lead to the particular signs and symptoms of the condition. variations in several genes have been studied as risk factors for restless legs syndrome. most of these genes are thought to be involved in the development of nerve cells (neurons) before birth. it is unclear whether any of the genes play roles in brain iron levels or in dopamine signaling. variations in known genes appear to account for only a small percentage of the risk of developing restless legs syndrome. changes in other genes, which have not been identified, probably also contribute to this complex disorder. researchers suspect that the early-onset form of restless legs syndrome is more likely than the late-onset form to have a genetic basis. nongenetic factors are also thought to play a role in restless legs syndrome. for example, several other disorders increase the risk of developing the condition. these include a life-threatening failure of kidney function called end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and parkinson disease. people with low iron levels associated with a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and women who are pregnant are also more likely to develop restless legs syndrome. in these cases, the condition usually improves or goes away when iron levels increase or after the woman gives birth. restless legs syndrome can be triggered by medications, including certain drugs used to treat nausea, depression and other mental health disorders, colds and allergies, heart problems, and high blood pressure. use of caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol can also trigger restless legs syndrome or make the signs and symptoms worse. in these cases, the condition usually improves or goes away once a person stops using these medications or substances.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]),

instructions for how to - read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten - make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat - design everyday meal plans for most people, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage. symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. the small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. complete healing can take several years in adults. once the intestine heals, the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally. some people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a gluten-free diet. the most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten, which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms. most people start responding to the gluten-free diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet. hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such as - modified food starch - preservatives - stabilizers did you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten? medications, supplements, and other products may also contain lecithin, a hidden source of gluten. people with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in - prescription and over-the-counter medications - vitamins and mineral supplements - herbal and nutritional supplements other products can be ingested or transferred from a person's hands to his or her mouth. reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure. if a product's label does not list its ingredients, the manufacturer should provide a list upon request. products that can contain gluten include - lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm - cosmetics - skin and hair products - toothpaste and mouthwash - glue on stamps and envelopes - children's modeling dough, such as play-doh some people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease. these conditions may include - small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine - pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice - microscopic colitis, an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope - ibs - lactose intolerance, a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products - other food intolerances, which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine in some cases, people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict gluten-free diet. people with this condition, known as refractory celiac disease, have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal. their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients, so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously. researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease. depending on a person's age at diagnosis, some complications of celiac disease will not improve, such as short stature and dental enamel defects. for people with dermatitis herpetiformis, skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet and may recur if a person adds gluten back into his or her diet. medications such as dapsone can control the rash's symptoms. dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, so people with dermatitis herpetiformis should maintain a

acute porphyrias a health care provider treats acute porphyrias with heme or glucose loading to decrease the livers production of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. a patient receives heme intravenously once a day for 4 days. glucose loading involves giving a patient a glucose solution by mouth or intravenously. heme is usually more effective and is the treatment of choice unless symptoms are mild. in rare instances, if symptoms are severe, a health care provider will recommend liver transplantation to treat acute porphyria. in liver transplantation, a surgeon removes a diseased or an injured liver and replaces it with a healthy, whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor. a patient has liver transplantation surgery in a hospital under general anesthesia. liver transplantation can cure liver failure. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, liver transplantation. cutaneous porphyrias the most important step a person can take to treat a cutaneous porphyria is to avoid sunlight as much as possible. other cutaneous porphyrias are treated as follows: - porphyria cutanea tarda. a health care provider treats porphyria cutanea tarda by removing factors that tend to activate the disease and by performing repeated therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron in the liver. therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of about a pint of blood from a vein in the arm. a technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, such as a hospital, clinic, or bloodmobile. a patient does not require anesthesia. another treatment approach is low-dose hydroxychloroquine tablets to reduce porphyrins in the liver. - erythropoietic protoporphyria. people with erythropoietic protoporphyria may be given beta-carotene or cysteine to improve sunlight tolerance, though these medications do not lower porphyrin levels. experts recommend hepatitis a and b vaccines and avoiding alcohol to prevent protoporphyric liver failure. a health care provider may use liver transplantation or a combination of medications to treat people who develop liver failure. unfortunately, liver transplantation does not correct the primary defect, which is the continuous overproduction of protoporphyria by bone marrow. successful bone marrow transplantations may successfully cure erythropoietic protoporphyria. a health care provider only considers bone marrow transplantation if the disease is severe and leading to secondary liver disease. - congenital erythropoietic porphyria and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. people with congenital erythropoietic porphyria or hepatoerythropoietic porphyria may need surgery to remove the spleen or blood transfusions to treat anemia. a surgeon removes the spleen in a hospital, and a patient receives general anesthesia. with a blood transfusion, a patient receives blood through an intravenous (iv) line inserted into a vein. a technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, and a patient does not need anesthesia. secondary porphyrinurias conditions called secondary porphyrinurias, such as disorders of the liver and bone marrow, as well as a number of drugs, chemicals, and toxins are often mistaken for porphyria because they lead to mild or moderate increases in porphyrin levels in the urine. only highnot mild or moderatelevels of porphyrin or porphyrin

chromosome 22 and the fli1 gene on chromosome 11. a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the ewsr1 gene with part of the fli1 gene, creating the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene. this mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. this type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. the protein produced from the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene, called ews/fli, has functions of the protein products of both genes. the fli protein, produced from the fli1 gene, attaches (binds) to dna and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. the fli protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. the ews protein, produced from the ewsr1 gene, also regulates transcription. the ews/fli protein has the dna-binding function of the fli protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the ews protein. it is thought that the ews/fli protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. this dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development. the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of ewing sarcomas. translocations that fuse the ewsr1 gene with other genes that are related to the fli1 gene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations

diagnosis of lactose intolerance. medical tests. a health care provider may order special tests to provide more information. health care providers commonly use two tests to measure how well a person digests lactose: - hydrogen breath test. this test measures the amount of hydrogen in a persons breath. normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath when a person eats or drinks and digests lactose. however, undigested lactose produces high levels of hydrogen. for this test, the patient drinks a beverage that contains a known amount of lactose. a health care provider asks the patient to breathe into a balloon-type container that measures breath hydrogen level. in most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. smoking and some foods and medications may affect the accuracy of the results. a health care provider will tell the patient what foods or medications to avoid before the test. - stool acidity test. undigested lactose creates lactic acid and other fatty acids that a stool acidity test can detect in a stool sample. health care providers sometimes use this test to check acidity in the stools of infants and young children. a child may also have glucose in his or her stool as a result of undigested lactose. the health care provider will give the childs parent or caretaker a container for collecting the stool specimen. the parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider, who sends it to a lab for analysis.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258,  4919,   284,  ..., 50257, 50257,

treatments for endometrial cancer ?<answer>key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - hormone therapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. the following surgical procedures may be used: - total hysterectomy: surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. - bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. - radical hysterectomy: surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. - lymph node dissection: a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibodies, mtor inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer. - monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. bevacizumab is used to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. - mtor inhibitors block a protein called mtor, which helps control cell division. mtor inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. - signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. metformin is being studied to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options by stage stage i and stage ii endometrial cancer low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2) treatment of low-risk stage i endometrial cancer and stage ii endometrial cancer may include the following: - surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. - surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by internal radiation therapy. in certain cases, external radiation therapy to the pelvis may be used in place of internal radiation therapy. - radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery. - a clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen. if cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done. high-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3) treatment of high-risk stage i endometrial cancer and stage ii endometrial cancer may include the following: - surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under

increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. in some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area. (check with a doctor or physical therapist to find out if heat or cold is the best treatment.) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). tens is a technique that uses a small electronic device to direct mild electric pulses to nerve endings that lie beneath the skin in the painful area. tens may relieve some arthritis pain. it seems to work by blocking pain messages to the brain and by modifying pain perception. massage. in this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. this may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. however, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease. acupuncture. some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. a large study supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) and the national center for complementary and alternative medicine (nccam) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care. nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have been reported to improve the symptoms of people with osteoarthritis, as have certain vitamins. additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. it is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. folk remedies include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing wd-40 on joints to lubricate them. although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. they can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. for general information about alternative therapies, see the complementary health approaches topic.<end>'}\n{'input_ids':

result from the loss of function of a gene called ube3a. people normally inherit one copy of the ube3a gene from each parent. both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. in certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. this parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. if the maternal copy of the ube3a gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. most cases of angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. in other cases (about 11 percent), angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. in a small percentage of cases, angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. this phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. rarely, angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of dna that controls activation of the ube3a gene. these genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) ube3a or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. the causes of angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases. in some people who have angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called oca2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. the oca2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. however, loss of the oca2 gene does not cause the

vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects. changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for anencephaly. however, none of these genes appears to play a major role in causing the condition. researchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. as mentioned above, folate deficiency appears to play a significant role. studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, including anencephaly. other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus, obesity, exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy, and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy. however, it is unclear how these factors may influence the risk of anencephaly.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,   389,  ..., 50257, 50257, 50257]), 'attention_mask': tensor([1,

the characteristic features of this disorder. clip2, eln, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, and limk1 are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with williams syndrome. researchers have found that loss of the eln gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this disease. studies suggest that deletion of clip2, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, limk1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with williams syndrome. loss of the gtf2ird1 gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition. researchers believe that the presence or absence of the ncf1 gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing hypertension in people with williams syndrome. when the ncf1 gene is included in the part of the

kidneys and make it harder for them to filter wastes and break down proteins. when the kidneys become too damaged, they may no longer be able to function well enough to maintain health, resulting in kidney failure. kidney failure can lead to problems such as high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemiaa condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. dialysis-related amyloidosis people who suffer from kidney failure and have been on long-term dialysis may develop dialysis-related amyloidosis. this type of amyloidosis occurs when a certain protein, called beta-2 microglobulin, builds up in the blood because dialysis does not remove it completely. the two types of dialysis are - hemodialysis. hemodialysis uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood. - peritoneal dialysis. peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavitythe space in the body that holds organs such as the stomach, intestines, and

learning what to expect in the days and weeks following surgery. it requires understanding what you will and wont be able to do and when. it also means arranging for social support and arranging your house to make everyday tasks easier and to help speed your recovery. find someone to stay with you because you will not be able to drive for several weeks after surgery, you will need someone to take you home from the hospital and be on hand to run errands or take you to appointments until you can drive yourself. if you live with someone, you should have them plan to stay home with you or at least stay close by, in case you need help. if you dont live with a family member or have one close by, a friend or neighbor may be able to help. other options include staying in an extended-care facility during your recovery or hiring someone to come to your home and help you. your hospital social worker should be able to help you make arrangements. prepare your home for your recovery to prepare your home for your recovery, stock up on needed items before you leave for the hospital. make sure you have plenty of non-perishable foods on hand. prepare meals and freeze them to put in the microwave when you need an easy meal. in the first weeks after surgery, you should avoid going up and down stairs. if your bedroom is on the second floor of your home, consider moving to a downstairs bedroom temporarily or sleeping on the sofa. set up a recovery station set up a recovery station at home. place a sturdy chair where you plan to spend most of your time sitting during the first weeks after surgery. the chair should be 18 to 20 inches high and should have two arms and a firm seat and back. place a foot stool in front of the chair so you can elevate your legs, and place items you will need such as the television remote control, telephone, medicine, and tissues where you can reach them easily from the chair. place items you use every day at arms level to avoid reaching up or bending down. ask your doctor or physical therapist about devices and tips that may make daily activities easier once you get home. devices you may find helpful include long-handled reachers to retrieve items placed on high shelves or dropped on the floor, aprons with pockets that allow you to carry items while leaving your hands free for crutches, shower benches that let you sit while you shower, and dressing sticks to help you get dressed without bending your new knee excessively. safeguard against falls because a fall can damage your new knee, making your home a safe place is crucial. before your surgery, look for and correct hazards, including cluttered floors, loose electrical cords, unsecured rugs, and dark hallways. bathrooms are likely places to fall, so particular attention is needed there. a raised toilet seat can make it easier to get up and down. grab bars in the tub can keep you steady. textured shapes on the shower floor can minimize slipping. gradually increase activity it is also important to exercise to get stronger while avoiding any activities that can damage or dislocate your new joint. activity should include a graduated walking program (where you slowly increase the time, distance, and pace that you walk) and specific exercises several times a day to prevent scarring, restore movement, and stabilize and strengthen your new knee. remember follow-ups your surgeon will let you know about follow-up visits. even after you have healed from surgery, you will need to see your surgeon periodically for examinations and x-rays to detect any potential problems with your knee. by preparing for surgery and recovery and following your doctor's advice, you can get the greatest benefits from your new knee with the least risk of complications

'<question>what causes prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia ?<answer>the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not well understood; however, it occurs mainly in older men. benign prostatic hyperplasia does not develop in men whose testicles were removed before puberty. for this reason, some researchers believe factors related to aging and the testicles may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia. throughout their lives, men produce testosterone, a male hormone, and small amounts of estrogen, a female hormone. as men age, the amount of active testosterone in their blood decreases, which leaves a higher proportion of estrogen. scientific studies have suggested that benign prostatic hyperplasia may occur because the higher proportion of estrogen within the prostate increases the activity of substances that promote prostate cell growth. another theory focuses on dihydrotestosterone (dht), a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth. some research has indicated that even with a drop in blood testosterone levels, older men continue to produce and accumulate high levels of dht in the prostate. this accumulation of dht may encourage prostate cells to continue to grow. scientists have noted that men who do not produce dht do not develop benign prostatic hyperplasia.<end>'}\n{'input_ids': tensor([50258, 10919,  5640,  ..., 50257,
